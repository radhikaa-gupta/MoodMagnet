its really worth every single penny it works like one ton ac provided that your room has proper ventilation i generally keep cooler near to window so that it can pull fresh air from outside and as a result i get very cool air one more suggestion please dont buy cooler which are equipped with a blower fan always go for the cooler equipped with metal fan like this one in one word this compton cooler is amazing if you find the review helpful please thumps up happy summer

great packaging by seller as this was the most important point while transportation from jaipur to chennai secondly product is quite huge and air throw is very much nearly 13ft at 2 speed and will give good breeze cooling is satisfying due to honeycomb cooling media no need of filling water daily price is high but product is quite satisfactory compared to others only drawback is the motor power is 190 w rather than 220w which should be coorected on specs information on flipkart good j

a great cooler in great price compact and great design body is made of good plastic and the cooling effect this cooler is too good even on a slowest fan speed ut gives best resultrecommended to allalso one thing i need to mentioned is the delivery man great guy helps me a lot to get this product
its an awesome product and i am not making any fake comments here i bought this just for trial to have a healthier ambience at home and i am happy that i made this choice it cools a room and keeps it cool all day and its best if you put it near a window or open door so that it pulls fresh air huge savings on electricity eco friendly and comfy

its been 6 days that i am using this cooler we have 1515 room after buying this cooler what i love is it has strong solid body so dont worry that it get broken easily you can fill water from front and back and give very cool air my room feel like its december in april i have to use extra blanket in night while sleeping it has capacity of 75 litre water which last for 2 days but i love to run cooler on pump for 1 hour it cool the whole room then only air mode and it gives awesome cool
very good quality product better than my expectations if you provide good ventilation it does nice cooling then i could feel the air 25 feet away couldnt try more than that but i think you could feel it a bit more far away as well water easily lasts for about 89 hours good in this price9200 range after 10 percent discount
delivery was on time flipkart service was awesome on time but the cooler doesnt seem to be so costly as it doesnt cool really well even after filling it up with full water it can be ok during warm nights but it wont make you feel any ease in hot conditions the plastic build also looks very cheap and below standard i am ok with it but not very satisfied
water pump is not throwing a lot of water thats why its throwing warm air not satisfied with this kind of pump quality i have paid a lot for this not worth the money there is no work of ice chamber i need a partial refund
a quality product from crompton it looks exactly like in the website is easy to set up and use please refer the room size charts while buying from the product line this one is meant for a somewhat large room there are 3 speed controls a couple more on the lesser side would have been better the smell from the cooling pads reported in a couple of other reviews was there but mostly dissipated within the first 8 hours of use finally this cooler consumes a lot of water 3lhr so it w
great job by fk faster delivery awesome product i got brand new air cooler at first i checked its sounds not bad as i read in reviewair delivery is much better one thing to say delivery boy most helpful so guys must go for it but i have doubt is this model same to ozone 55 because i ordered this got ozone 55 according to sailer both r same then why fk shows different model price
a good cooler by crompton the height of the cooler is about 3ft 10 inch color is nice plastic body is average air blow is good at any stage 12 or 3 air swing is also 3 choice when you switch it on for the first time after filling the water you will feel the nice cold air you will feel cool if you use it according to the weather there is a ice tray on the top overall a good cooler i will give 45 for design 35 for plastic body 45 for fan speed 45 for fan swing
very bad ever packageing by flipkart i have seen when i open its outer layer its been already open looks like used product air throw quality is not good as expected its water meter is very top of its water tank if you want to see its minimum level of water then u have to fill atlest 50 liter of water no any support of up and down its air wing and its not cover very much area overall just ok not very satisfied
great product this come with very nice packing by seller not a single crack or scratch in it also its brand new mfg and truly original generally people avoid this type of stuff online but i try also have return policy for any damage so i ordered it and within 3 days they delivered this amazing room cooler now come in price range its little costly but crompton didnt compromise quality major features already you can see in description other than this fan is little noisy and its wit
its been 10 days since im using this air cooleronce it is on we can feel cool breeze in 10minbut we feel humidity if we use it for more time which is common with air coolers easy to move and fill water cooler need to be drained often knob is down below near wheelsediting here after 3 months use i used hard water for 3months with frequent draining after 3months pump stopped pumping water and releasing hot air once it is oni opened and cleaned pads pump and water distribution pipes
crompton offers this range of coolers ozone with multiple capacity of water tank though the fan motor and air flow capacity remains the same which should not have been the case i bought the 88 litre model satisfied with cooling but the castor wheels are not strong enough for the weight of 88 litre filled water tank suggestion is to go for 75 litre instead of 88 litre variant
its vertical swing quality is bad when you set to upward then automatically it goes to down due to this air goes to down we cant set direction as we wantvertical swing is uselesswater filling opening box is too small when u fill with jug many water goes to outside cooler ice chamber is useless ice cube water goes to 88 liter chamber how some ice can cool 88 ltr ice chamber need to direct connect to honeycomb pad and slides that it cool instantlyit make some noise too during

flipkart delivered crompton desert air cooler 88 litres well before the schedule date before buying i compared with bajaj desert coolers here crompton seems to be much better based on the fan speed and quality water tank capacity of 88 litres is much needed crompton gives honey comb cooling pads for better cooling compared to wood wool it cools the room efficiently which makes us much comfortable in summer of chennai city
great product
wow great job flipcart fast delivery product arrived 2 days before expected date product is good and value for the money thanks
using it for last 10 daysone of the best coolers i have come across got it at a price of rs 8099 had a lots of research about coolers before buying it and here are my suggestions1 proper cross ventilation is required for optimal cooling so install it near the window where natural air circulation occurshoneycomb cooling pads are good as it has larger pores for air suction2 calculate air delivery requirement for your room desert coolers are generally meant for large rooms and hal

i am writing this review after 2 months of usage prosi am using this cooler in hyderabad around 11 x 14 sq feet room it perfectly really suits for this whether condition air flow is excellent it has an ice chamber easily movable using the 4 wheels providedlight weight vertical swing if i fill complete 75 liters of tank i get it for almost 16 hours i feel better performance when i open windows and use a tray of ice in the cooleryou can easily remove old water by pl
in gurgaon at 45 degree it is working on speed 1 like ac very happy with it finishing is not the best but it really does not matter when it give such cooling
this is a wonderful product at the mentioned price rangethe capacity of 75l makes it a wonderful to use product with one refill for upto 3 days6 hrs each dayit is easy to move and filling up of water with an inlet pipe can be done very fastthe inlet is in the front allowing external pipe to be fitted very easilythe cooler take 5 mins to reach full potential and then it cools the room so easily and effectivelytemp for a medium sized hall comes down from 40 to 28 celcius in 15 mins
cooling is good it depends where you placing cooler dont place the cooler close to window the humidity will be high keep the distance of atlist 89 feet from window and open the window ive already tried the same previously it was close to my window and it felt like more humidity wet body so irritating but now the distance is 9 feet from window and the right side of the cooler is face to window and the cooling is awesome now im decreasing the fan speed at night

i went on to buy this cooler reading the already posted reviews this device is awesome cools my room in 5 mins even though i never operate it on full swing the room gets really cold at night to the extent that i require something warm to cover myself up keep up the good work crompton
its a very good cooler cooling capacity is very good the best thing is that i have moving the cooler with full capacity 88l from one place to another i have used the ice chamber only once then i dont used the ice chamber bcoz the cooling capacity is very good and u dont need the ice after used 10days i have post my review without any 2nd thinking go for it
awesome productafter comparing with various brands like symphony usha orient i have chosen this i got this for 7600 works efficiently by placing it in a good ventilation area and run at low speed for better cooling can go for it without any second thought and you wont regret your decision
best of bestits a king of desert cooler plastic could have been better but thats not at all issue you can close your eyes and hit buy button very less noise great air delivery best cooling with 4 way deflection you may need extra extension board for this moving such heavy tank is easy on wheels there is lock too just beware of children at home they can easily put handfingers inside
crompton ozone 88 cooler was amazing we are fully satisfiedthanks to flipkartoverall experience is good value for money i recommend to everyone that you can buy this cooler without any doubt
good air delivery this is its pro and con because of heavy air delivery you cannot use this as fan otherwise this is very good if you live in hot dessert area do not buy if you are from humid coastal area it is not effective by a powerful fan instead
cooler is excellant giving air upto 15 feet in the room size 1215 feetgood design with no water leaks 3speeds even good cooling at lowest speed and used in summer with 40 deg c noise is morebut bearable honey comb mat is added advantageas per specs it consumes 190 wattsmovement is easy with castor wheels electric chord length is only one meteroverall best cooler in its range recommanded to othersi a rao
have been using for almost a month now one thing you definitely need to know is keep the cooler where fresh air ventilation is there otherwise the room will just become humid the cooling for me has not been that great dont know exactly how it provides maximum cooling and not make the room more humid using it in pune climate it partially does the job for me if anyone has had good experience with the product can help me out on how the maximum cooling can be achieved
best product packing and delivery i love this product i am totally satisfied with this product honey comb pad is good for extra cooling at this price it is a good deal
though the product is very good but the flipkart service is not upto the markfirst they sent me a damaged product with case openno shrink wrapbroken plugmultiple damageseven though there is a replacement policy it took time and my patience to deliver good producti fully recommend to buy this product but not from flipkart
excellent buy was a bit hesitant seeing the negative reviews even in the hottest day this cooler keeps the room cool with ltl ice added from the top tray have been using for few weeks and very satisfied with the purchase
writing review after 1 week usage this is brilliant cooler at the price i got this for 7600 after bank discount looks brilliant with white and blue color combination easy to move and cools nicely i will recommend to buy this
good product by crompton and flipkart delivery is good product delivered with original packing same as given specification i am satisfy with product cooling is good air delivery also nice thank you flipkart
i am writing this review after using cooler for a month i would say it is silent enough it cool down your bed room within 1520 mins so you can put it on before going to room as of now i am running it on level on and most of the time i have to switch pump off in mid night as you start feeling cold very effective cooling and run well on inverter excellent build quality you may feel fishy smell for few days but it will go off once you change water
best in the classextremely light and awesome looks and very easy to maneuver around thanks to the 4 wheels at each corner with wheel locking feature talking about its main function that is cooling so let me tell you it worth every penny and cools the room in around 10 min of medium size it got 5 iron blades which works fine and tank capacity is very large i would recommend go for the lower capacity which would cost 1000 rupees less
excellent cooler i was actually looking for a plastic body beautifull looking air cooler which can replace iron body exhaust fan cooler in my 500 sqr ft hall though no cooler can really replace the exhaust fan cooler but after using it for a week i can say that this cooler is the best among all and have excellent air throw with high cooling with no noise level and nice looks i purchased it after a lot of research and i am happy with the performance only better option is crompton optimu
writing this review after using this cooler for 4 months in nagpur where temperature goes till 48 degrees and is an extremely hot regionlight weight sturdy stylish does not make a lot of noise either this cooler will work absolutely fine until march but during the months of april and may when summer will be at its peak it will work only as a personal cooler and youll have to keep it hardly 1 meter away from yourself to feel the cool air
this is a cooler so please do not expect ac like cooling this provides good amount of cold air the room may become humid in placesregions with higher humidity so please use cross ventilation this is a value for money product and it is pretty big looks very good in room the air throw is sufficient for rooms with 150250 sqft size the delivery was good and the delivery personnel went out of his way to help get the huge package to 2nd floor thanks a lot
the cooler was home delivered it came in good condition the cooler operation is simple the wheels are sturdy and it is easy to move around the main problem is with the manual the manual does not give details on how to clean the filters and how to drain the water tank the manufacturer could have created a simple youtube video on how to do this and not left it to the amateurs
its excellentwill feel some odour for 1 or 2 days due to honeycomb but then the smell will gopls dont forget to have some space behind cooler otherwise humidity will increase i felt the same but when i changed locationit if giving wonderful resultsrequires ac comforters after 2 hourswater tank capacity is good and it will last for more than whole night in continuous usewater level indicator is very clear wheels are good and locking system is also there overall worthy and good
giving this review after 4 months usage this is really good cooler cooling 1211 bedroom within 2 hours but proper ventilation should be there lit it sound is there i think the sound is common for all coolers this is good recommended to buy
wonderful product as expected reduces the room temperature nice air flow intial use will give a stink smell after first five hours everything seems to be normal ice chamber does its job for best results mix some ice while filling the tank cord length is small but manageable flipkart delivered in a week packing was perfect 5 for now will re review after few weeks
loved it excellent air thruogh i searched almost 15 days for best cooler finally got good one with reasonable price thanks to flipkart and crompton
air throw is very disappointingi thought it was a good cooler but its not they mentioned that it is for 450sq feet but it cant even cool my little 150sq feet room in 40 degree temp also i have tried all the way for ventilation but it always creates humidity and thats the bad part i suggest to dont buy this you can even buy a local brand cooler from the show which far better than this
product is good with good look and compact designairflow is also good while considering for medium hallbut the problem is if you try to adjust ventsblades they will automatically bend downwards due to airforce it would be better if they stand still however we want
i have purchased this cooler from flipkart its an amazing products value for money you have to use blanket if you run this cooler at high speed even in hot hummid summer guys please go ahead and buy it this cooler can chilled a room size 400 to 500 sqft thank you flipkart i love this product
after use of one month very nice product work well less sound better cooling
its excellent product from crompton superb cooling without any sound light weight beautifully designed very good qualitythanks flipkart for amazing producti am satisfied with this purchase thanks a lot to seller and flipkart
it is old model and dont have outlet for draining dirty water we have to clean it manually and do lot of physical work usually the water becomes stinky once in a month we have to remove the screws and use motor to pump out the water the screws are not stainless steel so they get rusted easily and makes it difficult to remove the wheels get stuck within a month theres no manual how to remove and clean honeycomb the only positive point is its air throwing capacity and ability to cool
very good productreliable product from the brand not disappointed this tym after returning usha air king which was a wasteyou can go for this one for sure good air thrownice cooling ice chamber castor wheel evrythng working just great only one thing which i want to highlt is just the front louver the osclitor is good working perfectly but the front oscltor should hve been better overall great buy go for it
value for money but bit noisy good enough for large rooms need good air cross section water capacity is hugegood air throw noisy enough to keep outside cant watch tv while cooler is in room
i baught this cooler looking at the number of reviews and rating as i always do and as expected cooler built quality is good but the main function of cooling has a design defect the water supplied through the channel has some design defect because of which none of the honeycomb panels gets wet completely and hence cooling effect is very less people may not have noticed this if they are from relatively not that hot places like pune mumbai or bangalore etc i would not recommend this product
very good product if you have a cross ventilation in your room so this product is so nice for you very less noise and give a instant cool air a little humidity fan speed is very good appropriate value for money
it is a very good product you must buy it it has three side honeycomb pad and dis cooler gave a very nice air flow its exact height is 10 cm and you dont be hesitate to buy this product it has good swing and nice water tank of capacity 88 litres and i got a good delivery by flipkart and crompton is a good brand
not a great product the finishing of the product is not look like it is branded one just looks like ordinary roadside product not expected this type of product from crompton i have shared my view after 2 days of usage the 3 star is for its price go for symphony this is not trust worthy
good
this product is very nice and good the motor was working good at very speed and very cool
excellent air cooling the water will last you easily for two nights n the cooling gets real effective if u place it near a window n yes just make sure you change ur water every week so to keep it clean n free from any smell its size is similar to ur 16 l fridge but much slimer n yeah thats all for now but will update my review soon after quarter year

if placed in a well ventilated area the cooling of this desert cooler is pretty decent the water tank of 88 liter is enough for a full day continuous use built quality is robust the delivery experience was very good as the product was delivered with proper company packing and was handeled with care
cooler is good but air up done setting is not good but all is ok i am happy you can purchase this cooler very nice product
to be very honest with you i was a bit sceptical before buying this product wheather it will be able to live up to my expectationsbut after using this product for the last 5 months it has removed all the doubts i had yes a small shout to you guys over here its not a ac so dont expect it will cool the entire room within half an hour or it will work like a window ac and alli can share some tips which will definitely help you to get decent cooling experience make sure the water f

good product delivery boys good best coler thank you for filipcard
received a replacement for previously delivered damaged product replacement process was hassle free kudos to that this is a good cooler for the price totally worthy of 4 starsprosvery good cooling effectgood breeze speed breeze can be felt even 15 feet awayconthe body is not very sturdy although it can not be called weak either
not a good body delivery of this product is not safe it get break working is also not good
doesnt look that much fancy but rest when it comes to work it super and never water drop from its windows
very good and fantastic purchase i love it crompton is a brand and its quality meet brand value just go for it
build is strong dimensions is good fan throw is very good goes to 20ft very easilywheels are strong can easily move even when cooler is full very good product at this price range
satisfied with this product super air flow amazing built quality height is good cooling is also good its not offering many features but i think its main function as a good cooler its work best for me i review this after 1 month of used
cooler is nice but have some drawbacks as well i will focus on only draw backs because whatever feature it claims it has them upto mark 1 it is useful only for one person2 it will work only when proper cross ventilation is available other wise would create unbearable humidity in the atmosphere of your room or house3 front flabs are loos ened after use and they can not guide the air properly so everytime you will have to guide them in your direction it will irritate you especially i
i would certainly recommend symphony cooler in this range because earlier i hav experience with symphony and now i had purchased this 1 month agosymphony is superior to crompton1 less noise2 better air delivery
well i was confused between hindware and crompton but finally i went with this only as motor king is crompton only air flow is awesomelight weightcoolness is fantasticif you trust on brand you can blindly go with thiswin win situation thank you flipkart for awesome delevery experience as usual
crompton 75l desert cooler is the best coolerits cooling effect is very good even in moderate temperaturecooling remains for longer time not only when it is onand it cools large area for effective cooling not like tower or personal coolervery happy with purchase highly recommended for better and effective cooling
excellent cooler work well only when window are open for ventilation provide decent cooling with water when ventilation is provided
air cooler is working well giving heat relief from summer heat provided cross ventilation is good less noise its better to connect water hose to air cooler directly and due to water evaporation the 70ltr water doesnt last for the whole nightit has inbuilt wheels sturdy to move across the room highly recommend this product
excellent air cooler i am very happy and good sellers and good flipkart
good product on fully hot summer if you are living in place like humidity area it not helps to cool you
working well and cooling is also greati liked this product and ill also get a great deal as compared to market price
delievered in just 24 hours after the order which is in good condition as it is well packed cooling was very good when compared to previous coolers worth the money paid for it good service too
fantastic air throw and yet quiet fan great cooling and cool design
i ama truly satisfied with the product it cools the room very well even if the temperature is more than 42 degree celcius i live in a place where the temperature goes more than 40 degree in the mid summer i stay on the top floor but since i am using this cooler i am having no problem due to excessive temperature which i used to face before you just have to place the cooler in the right place with the right and scientific procedure
better plastic quality than symphony better price honey comb panelssleek suggest every symphony fan to give it a try as it is better in terms of product quality symphony quality has decreased a lot in few years
good product given same model which one i choose delivered safely i love flipkart services that i owe till now thanks flipkart team for wonderful job you are doing
in short it is better than snowcrest 85 which is one of the best air coolers out there crompton machines are less noisy and the air throw is wide and thats where snowcrest gets beaten but on the bright side the latter throws higher volumes of air i personally think that crompton is best for rooms whereas snowcrest from hindware is better suited for bigger halls
the best in this price range with excellent air throw sufficient for a hall and adequate cooling adequate ventilation is needed to work properlyworks best when kept near a window and another window should be opened to push humidity outwater lasts for 1 to 2 daysthis cooler can make the difference in hot climate when it brings down the room temperature the new smell goes off in a week a good choice to combat summer heatps thanks flipkart for the brilliant delivery
pros the best cooling out there with 75l liter capacity and plastic used is also really good cons plugg in cable length is not even half meter and huge noise which will not allow you to sleep so what is the point it is like giving you an ak47 without bullet you have a wonderful gun but you cannot use it for the purpose you got it for
cooler recd in good condition from flipkart within delivery timequality of cooler is so wise as per expectationair circulation and flow is too good with honeycomb colling effectthanks to flipkart for providing valuable product
good product works best when kept near a window and when outside temperature is low it cools like a mini ac overall nice product solves the purpose in places where temp raises to 35 to 38 degrees
very nice cool breeze liked it very much
just go for itone of the best model and best cooling efficiency compared to all other companies but place it before the window and enjoy the air conditioning loving iti bought it for 9878 which is an offer priceloved alot enjoying the chilling room

i bought this after comparing over 30 different types of coolers its cooling is good but nothing compared to desert coolers like kenstar cyclone 12 what i observed that the cooling pads at the back are not properly soaked in water compared to side cooling pads this maybe the reason why cooling is lesser still its better than most coolers out there in marketprosit looks classy low noisehuge 70l tankpowerful 180 degree airthrowconsno indicator light no single switch to turn o

it is worth every single penny i bought this cooler for the indoor room where air ventilation is not much but this cooler performs really well for that room the fan motor is very powerful and the water tank is also has a good capacity it cools the room very well where there is no ventilation if it gets the air ventilation it will perform much better please go for it but keep in mind the service for this cooler is very expensive more than acbecause the honey grass are real expensive

awesome cooler i got it in just 7999 which was a great deal just use it in a well vanitlated room and it works like ac
wow super cooling delivery date is 27may but excellent and fast flipkart delivered on 24may
very nice product this is the best product among all coolers available in the marketcool calm very useful for big as well as small rooms
good looks very nice cooling good storage capacity good build quality strong wheels
size is compact look wise is good noise is lessdelivery and packing is good tooi paid cash on delivery cooling is good enough for a roomi think not suitable for big hall
cooler is very compact and movable look wise greatperformance was good but not excellent as in extreme heat it doesnt cool as otherwise also difficult to clean the tank leading to stink
genuine feedback cooler is not so cool but below average it can prevent only the hot air blown by nature during hot climate in summer u can get the air like rainy day nothing else
superb cooler and working like 1tonac in my room satisfied with this product happily go for it
best air cooler worth money it works like acand compatible with inverter also
great product by crompton nice cooling nice looks nice wheels go for itonly concern is length of power cord but you can manage this with extension cordboard
am writing this review after using the product for a monththe built quality is good and the cooling efficiency is very nice when it is placed near to the windowthe only concern with it is no water outlet found at the bottom when you want to release the water or clean the cooler
excellent i recommend it but you need fill drinking water 25ltrs for 10 hours approximately and using soft water drinking is best to retain the water pump life little bit noisy in fast mode useful for 20 x 11 sqft area
cooler is great but its tough to serve the water into it is little difficult if the water resources are less with you but in terms of cooler its great enough for big hall 25x30ft
first of all a big thanks to flipkart for the fast delivery i loved this product from crompton i recommend if anyone wants to purchase this product
it is good productusing it in the hall and sitting on the sofayou feel the cool airits at a decent height
crompton ozone 75 is one of the best desert air cooler in market it is amazing product with great featuresless noisy and good cooling is one of the most important feature of this cooler
i have purchase in 7550 it is amazing cooler like ac
very silent and cool air thank you flipkart and seller

this cooler is wonderful i would say best desert cooler but do not buy it from flipkart at all they will pack it in worst way possible and their delivery guys will keep it in tampo with lots of load on iti received it as broken productand i know how difficult it was to get replacement in time their customer care representative gets payed only to apologize supervisormanagers even case escalate managers will have only sorry to share with youbuy this cooler but not from flipkart
i buy this product 55 dessert but total sent another product still now cant be returned5 times technician visit postponed and some times automatically return rejected by flipkart after i call the flipkart customer care but they agreed the problem and still product cant be retu
item is good but delivery service of flipkart delhivery courier service is worst
very good coolerone thing you should have is cross ventilation then it will like 1 ton ac
value for money
excellent product excellent delivery specially excellent behavior of delivery agent noise is very low fully satisfied 10 out of 5 i am from west bengal and there is not any single scratch on the product due to delivery reason excellent no leakage issue in honeycomb pad everything is fine bohot dino ke bad chain se sone ko mila yaar just fill up 75 liter tank with 4 to 5 large bucket of water and enjoy special warning dont switch on the pump regulator wit
i did not like this product its fan doesnt work properly the engineer comes and gives false hopes to my parents and returns back anf you guys have cancelled my refund this is ridiculous this is a waste productjeeves and flipkart have duped us big time
excellent meet requirements heavy duty less noise work like an acgood light designed body
speed and cooling are awesome but noisy gives you ac feeling wish i could get it in low noise its a huge one
good swing cooling i am very happy
nice cooling wonderful product
very nice product i give 5 star
very nice cooler and cooling very fast and plastic body is durable
after doing lot of research i bought this cooler last week air flow is very good cools room easily water lasts for nearly 1 day it smells early but it is bearable and lasts for 2 days only i want a cooler for indoor and it is perfect for it not so bulky as like other coolers you can move it easily even its tank is full so buy it without any hesitation
cooling is good with low noise and fan speed is goodpackaging was properly donestill it had a few scratches at the top of cooler but nothing majorlookwise its nicefull water tank goes for 23 nights so refill frequency is manageablevalue for money product
received product with out any damage service was really fast cooler is just awesome it just works like ac dont feel that its summer nowstasified with product go for it
best cooler air delivery high other cooler air delivery v bad but this cooler is best
good but after 4 months use the hinges which direct air are falling downand not good air throwmore sound
prosbuild quality looks excellentfan speed and cooling phenomenalwater lasting entire day full tanknoise acceptableair throw wide and sharpwheels tough enoughvalue for money undoubtedly extremely recommendedconspackaging could have been betterdelivery period too longmore than 5 daysbehavior of delivery boy rude illiteraterobberwas demanding for extra money to deliver on time
water pump was not working
received defective product auto swing is not working properly better to purchase product from shopmarket where u can replace the product within a single day in my case they gave given me the 12days as a pickup time
good
best product in best price range
product wise its finebut this time delivery service was pathetic
product received good but its air flow i have confusion very less coll my 810 room i am not feeling more cool

the product i got is opened delivery service is not goodwant to return this product
it is a small and powwrful cooler perfect for a mid sized room found it better than many existing brands
very good product
not delivered as promised delivery person asked us to pick up with our own expenses which was around 20 kms
i m very happy with this productthanks flipkarteveryone can buy this cooler highly recommendedcooling is faster than other coolerone of the best cooler in marketthanks flipkart once again
dont buythe smell which comes from cooler is unbearable sensitive persons might get breathing issues coming to performance it is a table fan which sounds like a generator you will regret after buying once bought you cant return
very bad quality very poor plastic material very cheap product showing it fr 17k and then discounting it and selling fr 10k still costly as per product received just fooling people in the name of brand third class product very much disappointed from flipkart requested for return and refund on the same day refund request rejected now forced to replace the product never buy crompton and use flipkart for buying
cooling wise its good but when we taking about noise its too noisy the water dropping noise will irritate youalso it comes with only honey comb pad its big disadvantage is the insect will easily inter through holein this price range go for bluestar windus cooler it is coming with hybrid pad
good product good pricing and good performancei love flipkartthanks
delivery of the product is very nice in short time it was delivered to me product is very good i am writing this after 7 hours of it use 55 ltr water finished after 7 hours this gives a natural chill air if you run at minimum speed during heavy summer season this will surely give comfort i am fully satisfied with this product
please mention the cooling area in sqft what is the cooling capacity capable area
it was really bad experiences with flipkart this time the delivery person was want deliver the item on road rather than mentioned address

writing after 2 months of usage we typically have 4045 c semidry weather during summer and this cooler tried its best to keep temperature around 30 c during nights it reaches till 24c but it only works in a well airy crossventilated roomhealth warning you can get minor lungsbreathing related issues but its rare
good for small rooms
good air throw smooth wheels
room is heated up even after using the cooler

low cooling with low rom
very good air cooler
very nice product
best product in this price
best cooler
very bad experience this cooler not god and price high
while the fan and motor quality is good the problem with this cooler is its body the plastic is not very strong and the vent in front is problematic as the horizontal plastic pieces do not remain at their place leading to less air flow it is a big let down and request crompton to replace the plastic mesh in future rest of the body is also quite shaky
iron body cooler are better
very bed cooler its sound too much
fine product
cooling is awesome and colour quality and everything is very good worth of each penny loved it
searched many cooler and after reading many reviews i selected that cooler and realy its good cooling is realy good in ventilated area if you sleep in front of cooler you feel temperature around 1822 degree c but i found front louvers are not settled properly
it is very good cooler and cooling capacity is very good less noise and it is very good product at that price
perfect go ahead
nice product
cooling not proper
auto water filleup not theretoo much sounddifficult to cleancross ventiliter required for cooling
mony is wasted not ear
one of the best desert cooler my honest opinion that if you will give proper ventilation in front of the cooler you will get very cool air through like ac in this price segment this is superb you can go for it without any hesitationi will give 9 out of 10 for north and west indian summer days
ok good

want to spend 10k for a fan then go for it i never expected this kind of trash bad customer support from crompton the reason is we ordered this cooler based on the positive reviews but its doesnt cool even a 1010 size room even though room have good ventilation only the size of the cooler is huge ozone 75litre but not the output we contacted flipkart customer care for many times they took complaint and technicians visited 2 times but still the issue is not yet solve
its cooling is very nice easily cool 2 room
overall good product
closed your eyes and buy this cooler you will never regret

nice air cooler butdont expect more air like acits just a fan with more speed and feel normal cool
best cooler
so far nice hope my reliance on crompton will remain the same
fabulous
the cooler is sturdy with a nice build quality and design cooling and the air throw rate is good even the ice charm works like charm however the water level drops too quickly even after its large tank capacity which needs refilling twice or thrice in peak season apart from it everything is great nice product from crompton
air throwing distance is very low
the cooler is good performance is great features are also good as compared to the priceonly one issue is there is with the body plastic quality is not so goodnd finishing could be better at some places like the buttons the grill some parts seem delicate in comparison to other brand like symphony coolersi have to keep my kids away so that the body does not get damaged but the price is half compared to other branded coolers hoping that it will provide tension free service for years t

fantastic product by crompton
not a good oneits not throwing any cool air and a lot of noisy
little noisy but cooling is awesome
cooler body quality is very bad its very fragile plastic body with the side doors knobs provided not so good once side door is opened does not fit again correctly refilling water is also pain with the knob provided at back being very loose and leaks water when refill is done unless you are very cautious there is no way to drain water you need to either remove water using mug or reverse the filler cooler upside down i recommend not to purchase this cooler and look at some other cooler wh
well designed cooler only one drawback i felt is the length of the power cable is too short working in good condition
its very good value for money
good product but electric cord is short
good
awesome
builtin quality is good sound is high
poor quality
writing after 2 month of use product is good very less noise and good air throw quality this is having only two side deflection up and down need to be done manuallyoverall good product got it at around 8500 so value for money

good product
after 20 days the cooling goes down you dont fell how the 1st day it was dont know where exactly the issue lies even after representative visited same
very nice
good product features are good plastic quality is good go for it

awesome
cooling system is good but body material is so poor
nice and fully satisfied
nice
nice air flow feeling cold in night with this aircooler
dont go on flipkart review i purchase this cooler but totally waste of moneyp
low quality product silver alluminium motor windingair flow is very low i bought same model 5 years back and that has copper motor and the airflow is too gud but now crompton started making aluminium motors due to which airflow reduces about 50 and plastic body is also made of very cheap material
i am happy with this cooler thank u
not to the expectations low garde plastic used swing isnt adjustable water pump replaced 4 times in 3 months over all waste buy
excellentgrt productsometime use it in place of acdelivered on timein good conditionthnx to crompton n flpcrthope such service in future alsoone can buy to get full utility
awesome cooler very good quality and beautiful cooling good and not much sound u can go with this without thinkingawesome
nice product i like it
after use 1year 1 month use regular 3months water pump not working crompton use very bad product
best cooler available right now in the market
water pump motor failure after buy with in a month and no service provided by crompton
good quality product
apart from the drainage point which is not given anywhere makes it very difficult to clean rest is fine
this product is very good
good product
very poor quality and i received a defective product
water is not pouring from holescrompton services are not good
great air throw but keep it in a proper ventilation or else a lot humidity will occur
good product
very nice product
big and sound
awesome productthe cooler is very nice looking and best part is that it performs its task brilliantly the overall noise of the cooler is manageable the motor speed options are also very useful tank capacity is also more than enough the vertical swings works perfectly but one con is that the horizontal swing is fixed the only thing to keep in mind is that gives proper ventilation space to the cooler to achieve the optimum results delivery was done before the scheduled time
good
within one year you may lost fan motor without any special cause when it is runningstarting
excellent product
nice
very very bad product guys please dont buy this product overall bad experience on this product
simpleit cant compete a desert cooler or ac if you actually cant manage desert cooler fixing on your window i mean if you are on first floor where there is no way to hang a desert cooler on your window then only go for it you cant sleep first 15 days with it due to bad smell and after 15 days you have to compromise with it good for places which has no option for ac or fix desert coolerso i have simply waisted money on it due to few chamcha reviews anyhowhave purchased and
best
this product is very nice and its quality is also goodand a cold wind is blowing

first of all thanks to flipkart for cutomer support but i am little disappointed with this product air flow is good but water flow is not good it does not speread proper on the cooling pad and the ice chamber should be directly connected with the cooling pad instead of main tank
good product

the cooler looks good but it is as not effective as it is detailed the length of the pipe that connects the water motor is too short and keeps coming out
its amazing received on time there is no any damage cooling also very good thank you flipkart
disgustingi had ordered this product with very high expectation today on 19062021 i have received this product but unfortunately the product is found damagedand its such a disgusting product because we have to adjust the front grills after every 5 minutes as its comes down we have also use mseal to repair the damaged partreally we didnt expected such bad product from flipkart
i love flipkart for delivering the product in excellent conditionafter 2 months of usage the product working fine
wonderful
product is good but its air flow is not 45ft as it says its only 2025ft not cooling room that much but one good thing that for one person it is best you can install it in room as it does not cause humidity overall good product

flaps got loosed in a week automatically getting down
not sutisfiedvery bad product
reviewing after 1 month usepro1 less noise2 powerful enough 3 good cooling 4 plastic quality good5 so far motor is working finecons1 ice chamber uselessno extra effect instead directly put ice in cooler tank2power cord is little bit short
after 2 month review air through cooling is not that good and the major problem is when we start rotation wing mode than vertical wing clash with horizontal wing due to it some row of horizontal wings get damaged really disappointed after paying that much facing such problem while using rotationdont go for this cooler
very good product
good product from cromptonpros 1 air throw is good2 cooling is goodcons1 build quality is not that good
nice
it is best for living room
nice product
an amazing product does its work perfectly 1 suggestionfront lower move down with air flow so put lock system or anything that lower dont move
nice product cooling is good water consumption is little but high but the product is awesome
not recommended it works same as other cheap cooler
the blades keep on falling downwards towards the ground and all the air flow is directed on the floor didnt like that part need to manually adjust the blades bt in no time the blades direct towards the floor cooling is not much satisfying the air flow is good
this air cooler is so badest product in the world dont buy this cooler
this is very bad product so i request everyone please dont buy this product
cool
nice product
its ok cooler if put ice it cools good but it needs proper ventilation and think fan dont move that fast it can be better but it dont make noise plastic is not too bad not too good its ok cooling is decent but not worth money if its price is 7000 8000 than it is ok but it is not worth its price
delivery was on time and the delivery men were quite responsible and helping guysbut as far as functioning is concerned its just ok kind of product
overpriced and not a very good finish on the coolers plastic bodyotherwise its fine
good
we purchased this one on 26th june 2020 its working perfectly

what could have been an excellent buyturned out to be an average review1 cooling is ok 2 technical specs and sturdinessonly time will tellbut i am not worried since i bought extended warranty 3 the direction louvers do not hold up and always point to the feetthe best cool airdoesnt reach you4 ice box is a jokeat best a gimmick5 the fan speed is too fasta simple continuous speed reducerlike a fan pregulator instead of a 3 speed knob would have made the prod

i am writing this review after using the same model last 2 yearsvery nice cooler and cooling
it can not throw air upto 20 ft and crompton has mentioned it can throw air upto 45 ft so dont fall for that

good cooler with many features but used low quality plasticotherwise product is very good

good condition but but its pump switch is not available

nice built qualityif you clean the honey comb panel every year you will get even betterperformance for many years
i am giving 4 stars for this product after using for 10 days
very good product value for money
everything is ok but the main problem is in the horizontal blade the horizontal blade which is used to change the direction of flow of air ie up or down getting down automatically due to the vibration of the cooler i have informed the customer care they raise a ticket for this issue i dont know when it will get resolved
very nice
good packing and no any troble
best cooler for indoor must buy it

this review i am writing after using this air cooler for a month time the air blow at minimum speed level itself it is very good the build quality is impressive the noise level is also less when compared with other coolers most importantly it takes maximum 30 minutes to cool your room i found the water consumption level is also less with this air cooler overall worth for money
produ ct is good but while moving from one place to another in home back wheels are bend after and cant replace as 7 days over i am very disappointed what should i do
cooling is best but 2 star deducted because little bit noisy and for smell after first time use
good fan speed that gives cool air easy to move
super cool nice cooler
as a brand i believe it works long and satisfied with product
very good
no cooling
overall good but noise is high
very nice
still not attended by crompton for demo n installation

nice product

good
amezing product good quality good fan speed it wont take long time to cool down 1020 room temperature also it wont use much electricity its power consumption is good and efficient
good one
nice colling is good
i guess due to pandemic flipkarts customer support has gone into hibernation and due to that the wrong product i received thats sellers fault i got terrible experience with their support and talk about the product average built got defective wheels and it will trouble you to move it around easily when fully filled cooling is same as what a standard cooler does what you expect some gasfilled air conditioning from a cooler
excellent product by crompton one suggestion that it has no water removal tap from back side
cooling capacity is not good as i expect
awesome cooler i like this cooler and i m happy with dis
water pump was not working after many calls followup neither technician visited or flipkart replaced the product first time worst experience
it is good in cooling and easily movable and working nicely but the buttons on the cooler are old in model
performance is nice build is strong power cord given at the wrong side thus deducted a star
not bad
good product in this price
its become excellent but fan speed so much according to me fan has 5 speeder
nice
good
nice
this product stands upto its value 3 speed air control along with deflection is very good the cooler provides good cooling effect in one big room
good quality good cooling

nice product
good
nice big size product and performance but there not to easy change water or cleaning
1 the fan speed was too good 2 cooling is very nice and in summer too it had given immense cooling effect355 litres capacity so half day sufficient for usagein summerin winter more hours it will run with that water4 there is valve at bottom so we can drain out the water and can keep it aside in non usage period like winter5 shape was too good go for it blindly
