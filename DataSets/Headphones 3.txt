honestly best earphone ive ever bought antinoise you can use it continuously for many hours very good battery backup boat earphones are maybe the best ever i got must buy
best in class of bass you cant feel the dolby type effects like the sound goes from left to right only you can feel a heavy bass and heavy sound from both the end no compromise in sound i felt if you look forward a clarity sound effects on your ears like dolby atoms then go for sennheiser or sony
i just loved it it is terrific product same as shown n wrking vry well thankuuuu flpkrt

sound quality and bass is satisfactory if you want something really extraordinary you may not get that its overall perfect as it suites all my needs the best part is the battery i charged it fully on the it came and its been 7 days ive been using aprox 3 hrs a day and i am surprised it shows 70 battery left my purpose of not having a cable and not charging again and again and getting a good comfort while using is achieved im satisfied
m using the boat since 2 years but not this colour m using the blue variant of same product the bass is awsome the build quality is awsome tthe sound quality also awsome i love it at the time of purchase my mind was going for the new brand like house of marleyjbl etc but i loved this and m order this item this is the best budget head phone in under 2000 sasti masti
sound quality is really impressive at this price its really good and comfortable headphone but for gaming i shouldnt prefer this like pubg if u purchase this only for high bass
great product good in sound function and battery backup works well with pubg and other apps overall it is a good product and with good price tag
awesome product i am happy and this is ultimate headphone for who travels rides and loves musiconce i charge it for very less time and its battery stands for 3 or more daysthis product is worth and value for money the build quality is also good
good bass and great battery backup could have improved the built quality for maximum comfort however this is best in its price range ear cushion padding could have been better to absorb the swet due to continuous usage

i have been using it for more than 10days and i have charged it only twice till now excellent battery backup i am a movie lover and these headphones lie around my head all the day it is very good option for virtual music experience but with prolonged use of hours together you may feel little bit pain of your ears as it covers all your ear apart from thay very good product value for money fast bluetooth connectivity overall excellent product

awesome product with proper design and facilities that fill my desire and enhance my interest toward music which is an antidote to me against pressurised studiesi love it and also recommend to all other rockers of musicsbut it came with only usb without any plug point or charger points
i am fond of headphones and personally listened to many of them but this one is little out of edgemeans zyada ummeed par kam khara utrai listened to it continuously for 2 hours and my head got doomedobviously because of 50mm driversvoice leakage is not liked by many unless you use it to disturb your partners so volume control is necessary in this casebass can be felt on your ear lobesnoise cancellation is goodgamers can enjoy this headphonego ahead if you are only bass lover as the a
very good product i bought it today and i used it for the whole day finally im writing the reviewsound quality well balanced neither so loud nor so weak extraaaa bass is written on the packet but its bass is not so extraaa you know i will reccomend to buy this product this product will not make your money waste
the bass is superb in this when you increase the volume but sound quality interms of other aspects seems to be a bit average performanceits good for bass centric songsbut not good for romantic or heart soothing songs also there is a sound leakage in top volumealso feels bulky and weight compared to other headphones
awasm headphones in this price i got this in only 1500 which is the best value product awasm look nice sound quality everything good in thisi recommend you to purchase this product
received the product on time and the headphones are extra fabulous bass effect is too much works perfectly without any connectivity lag totally satisfied with the seller and delivery service recommend other users to purchase this at the cheaper price

good sound bass and battery backup bad pathetic design bcz it hurts within 15mins of use sound leaks from the headphone even at low volumefor comfort motorola over the ear headphones r the best n too much comfortable thn the boat roackerz boat should adabt the comfort n design from the motorola over the ear headphones everything else is good in boat
as being a regular sennheiser user i was skeptical about buying this boat headphone but the very low price was the lure factor i bought this for gaming actually it works pretty well paired with my smart tv the sounds are not crystal clear like the sennheissers its just you get a decent headset for all your needs without burning your pocket it is comfortable to wear however after 2 hrs ur ears get hot feel a slight pain battery backup is good i didnt measure it though but it las
sound is good and pleasantearcups are comfortablebattery life is very goodonly drawback is they cant be fold and bass is also not very highhence if you are looking for bass then go for jblotherwise these are the best with best design and comfortnote there is half a second delay while playing pubgwhich in most bluetooth headphones is samehence go for the wired one or use them as wired headphones to get crystal clear sound
really its awesome headphone i loved it thanks to boat company and flipkart for offering this amazing headphone and great price
used it for around 3 months it works very well with bluetooth than the aux cable but its not a big issuethe only problem i faced is that i can not use it for long time because my ears are not completely into the ear pads for this issue i recommend boat rockerz 600 as i have used that earlier it is more comfortable and easy to carry as it is foldable
amaizng bass battery backup very good design superb and gym lover also love it
very nice quality the built in design is more than up to the mark the sound quality is awesome and is worth buying
super product looking smart and sound quality is superb base is extraordinary im satisfied in this purchase
its a very useful fantastic product when i connected with bluetooth with my phone and listened the song ek ladki ko dekha to aisa laga in youtube i felt its sound is very pure and very sweet
great bt headsets for bass heads battery life is good built quality is also nice give it a time for 34 days to open up not for people looking for crisp sound good for bass type music and general video watching overall it is value for money product go for it
reviewing after 15 days i have to say this is the best headphone u can get under 2000 battery backup is superb it is nearly around 10 hours build is superb soft ear cups the only think i dont like is that these r not foldable thats sit although value for money i got it around 1300 during bbd
battery backup is awesome it works without charging for couple of weeks on using 12 hours daily sound quality is awesome and its same as compared to mi wired headphones may be little but more design is awesome but wearing it more than 3045 minutes it starts to hurt your ears cusion could have been much softer overall its best out there and recommended to anyone
i think it has average quality sound but base is good in this price range mot important feature is i use it when battery is low and it work properly battery life is good
i am highly impressed with this product it is best in every aspects specially for wfh and online classes anyone can talk on call easily i am highly impressed with delivery experience specially open box delivery
purchased on 6 october 2021 honest review on 20 september plastic build is solid and not much flexible not foldable too nd too much treble no bass is there u cant listen to anything at full volume headache cushioning are ok okwhen any bass comes it started to make abnormal noises

this review will be helpful for those who have used sony xb55ap i have used xb for 3 years so my review will be based on it1 for music its good but not anywhere when compared to xb 55 ap2 for gaming when using with cable there is no latency but when connected with bluetooth there is considerable latency also audio quality in game is not upto the mark footsteps of enemies is not audible from a distance but with xb it is better3 long time usage not for long time use as it

the one good quality is that its battery backup is excellent there is written only for 10 hrs but the thing is that from using day its my 6 day the battery is 70 wow amazing and one profit is that it both wireless and wired but i prefer you to use wireless because the sound the base is high rocking but in wired their is no bass and sound is lil low love this product

honestly i had ordered the rockerz 400 first and they didnt seem that great but then i asked for a refund and ordered these 510 in blue and even though i was sceptical about it at first im glad i went ahead and purchased it because the headphones have great bass and sound and the battery backup is just amazing i charged them 2 days ago and i use them w bluetooth for atleast 3 hours a day and they are still at 90 or 80 the cushions for the ears are mindblowing they are so soft and com

in this price range this boat 510 is mindblowing dill its built is good but not portable and is good but its main thing is its super bass this was awesome i love it
amazing product checked many product read many reviews of this product trust im very happy only one thing i found its little bit large in size but its depend on your head size but its fit for me
its very good headphone i got it in 1400 during sale its bluetooth is working perfectly and battery backup is just awesome however i must say the soak used to cover ear is kinda uncomfortable if you use it for more than a hour your ear might hurt cause its not very smooth soak its kinda rigid however due to that it provide a good cancelation of outside noise but still it could have been made a little more smoother other than that its good and when you also getting 1 year warranty replace
sound was good battery backup is well enough u can listen enough music and video in a single charge very good products to buy in a small budget satisfied with this product but only concern is delay delivery i got it 6 day later other wise all ok delivery boy brings it very carefully packed well thanks for all things
its cool but not comfortable looking awesome unique design i lovethen sound quality is perfect bass is okay its not a extra bass it just marketing tricks but good bad on this price range you want boom bass you go to jbl t350 cost at 2500 but under 2000 boat rokerz shines
received product in 7 days got in nice and good packaging bass is very nice high notes are good lows and mids are superbfor music recommendfor gaming you have to use aux cable quality of aux cable and charging port is decent quality of headphone is very good thankyou flipkart

very good clarity and battery backup also i didnt charged yet using daily an hour from purchasing i am eagerly waiting for charge that it is almost 8 days over not yet charged still its running very good battery backup as well as sound clarity
i am using this headphone for like a week and below are the problems i faced with this headphonenot comfortable yes it is not comfortable my ear hurts after using them for like 12 hours they should have made foam more way betterfake battery promises they say the battery lasts more than 10 hours but it is a big lie my headphone battery works only for like 45 hoursheadphone turns off immediately on low battery this headphone does not alert a user before some time tha
very good product happy with its sound quality and look reason for 2 stars is that its heavy weight and its larger size makes me uncomfortable while using it and its very tight for my ears in fact i got pain in my ears while using it for 1 hour only for feeling comfortable i had to increase its size and that doesnt fit in my headthere is a second reason also that we cant carry it out of our home due to its larger lookproduct is good for home base use
i bought this specifically for gaming sound quality is not up to the mark cant distinguish between footsteps in games like pubg i have used boat earphones and trust me they are way better than this build quality is good but not for gaming as advertised
before buying i read many reviews everybody says its good dealbut its disappointe mesound quality not good i am use senhisser cx 180 earphone and its awesomeboat 510 sound not clear and after use some time pain in ear the problum in their design boat 600 design much better
no words to say an extra ordinary product pretty good sound quality and good looking also just go for it guys
awesome headphone in this price segment the sound quality is good for itself the design is cool and it looks like a gaming one as i am a gamer the packaging is good enough i got this product in its best price on big billion day with codthe only thing is that we can use this as a wired too thats pretty cool but when i use it for gaming purpose there is no mic for this i cannot talk with others i dont know why this but the product is awesome you guys can definitely go for it
the product is very good the noise cancellation is not that much good but i think u can still try it and most importantly u might write ther review after 10 to 15 days of usage i am also writing it ater 7 days and there is no problem till now the bass quality is very good and the design is badass in last it is worth to buy it thank you for reading this is worth to buy u can use for daily use and gaming

this product is very good it has very good sound quality i have used it for 3 years it hai uptil now best sound quality and very longer battery
very nice product surely buy this product love it awesome thanks flipkart for this product love it
its not comfortable because of its heavy design and not foldable you feel so much heavy its not flexible i will not recommend this product to any one comfort is the most important thing to listen and enjoy the music which you will not get in this product so i recommend everyone please purchase flexible and foldable earphones
best wireless headphones in this price segmentsound quality is excellent its battery is so powerful you can use it more than 20 hours if it is not charged you can use it like wired headphone
at the price range1099 it is beast sound quality is awesome bass is good and build quality is also noice for the first time you may feel it heavy but after 2 to 3 day of ussage you will get comfortable with it but still if you want more lighter product you can check another but it may cost you moreof boatoverall it is value for money
the best headset for gamers and this might give you pain on your ears for a few days but it will be alright if you use it properlythe bass is awesome as mentioned in its namein my opinion it is best to use it wireless while playing game like bgmi
i am giving a review after 7 months of use i loved it so much its battery bakup is super i use it for 2 to 3 hours a day i bought it in october 2021 and charged it for the first time it worked for almost two and a half months without being charged sound quality is also good
very nice headphoneits sound quality is superior bass is op i use it wirelessly with my laptop and believe me with some tuning in the audio software it gives the best audio experience of all the timei had been using a frontech headphone before this though it was very lighter than this its sound wasnt too good and its ear pads started to wear out very soonone thing i noticed disappointing in one of its side it feels no bass secondly its littlebit heavy its little bi
too good product this headphone boat rockerz 510 is too good this product is value for your money i would recommend this product for people who want headphones for listening music although the sound quality of this product is excellent but is audio jack is not so good nevertheless ive given it 4 stars because its bluetooth connectivity is better as compared to other bluetooth headphones and its sound quality is excellent at the beginning you would find some problems with its bluetoot
pros1 connectivity with bluetooth and aux2 noise cancellation3 cushioning is great4 bass is best in class no other headphone can beat its bass these headphones have better durability5 seller and flipkart did there work effectively with early delivery than the promised date6 amazing battery life7 overall sound quality is good with responsive lowmid and high8 can play different geners effectivelycons1 not comfortable for long time2 fix design cannot flip and
not comfortable over the head sound quality is not that much good that i expected and ear comforter is not good sometimes comming out and not fitting covering ear llp
my god better than expected dont explain by words im telling you the truth that this is the one only best headphones over the head i give my review after 15 days check all of its functions all are amazing the bass is vibrate all your ears the sound quality is crystal clear battery backup oh god just amazing the build up quality is dashing give you a handsome looktrust me dont read any review after this one this product is worth its price value for money
awesome product with productive bass and very good battery performancethe connectivity range is more than 10 mtrs sufficient enough for mehappy with the product would recommend everyone
i loved it very very nice product sound clarity is tooooo good
what a excellent blutooth device everyone must try it kids r happy with this device and it very useful for online classes in todays condition
this headphone is giving more battery backup than mentioned by company and no compromise by sound quality its bass can be little more but it can do your work in this price segment i can its the best head phone you can get but its not that comfortable after 4 hour your ears are started hurting
just amazing as expected this was my first ever wireless headphones from boat the reason i give it a 4 star rating is that i have to claim the warranty in 15 days but before i claimed the warranty it was just amazing you can wear it for the long period too its just perfect fitting of the cushion and the main highlight of this headphones is its bass and its 50 mm driver it gives you amazing sound quality you can buy it in sale for lesser price
worth every penny excellent heads phone crystal clear sound it will take you in other world if you r bass liker this set is made for you amazing battery backup over all just buy it and enjoy please remember you can not get quality of bose in 1500 bucks hence price wise it is best
its a headphone that i really searching for or i want sound quality is very nice and its design and colour touches my heart thank you boat and thank you flipkart
good nice and beautiful i like it my first head phone
product is good but in my case mic is not working i have tried in my mobile and laptop also but the mic is not working what should i do otherwise the headphone is good i have not charged my headphones from 2 months then also batteryis running i like the battery quality of this headphones and the bass sounds cool every thing is good but 1 thing i hated of this headphone that is mic problem i have fixed the drivers also of this headphones but then also the mic is not working so i will gi
i am using boat from past 16 years it is very nice product durability is very good but ear buds or sponge need to change after 2 years usage mechanically no damage or difference observed while using i am a daily usager with mobile and laptop and smart tv non stop i am using from past 2 years price is also good
product is super full bass is little less but can be fix with the help of equaliserbattery backup i purchase on 16 feb am use it for total 12 days 23 hrs per day usagesound sound is crystal clear every beat and instruments u can hearpubg half sound is sufficient for clear footstep pain in ear little pain sometimes i feel but not so much
i m reviewing it after using it for 6 months i used it everyday about 6hrs a daythe bettery life is still good sound is same it is good for those people who likes beatzzbass even soft songs are also gives good feelingusing it with aux is giving more clear audio i recommend it to buy this without waisting time it is best in this range
this is good product and the sound quality is good and gamers should use this with the urx wire because in gameing experience i feel that the foot steps are hearing me after 1s this is best for gamers but wire is very necessary in this situation and this is good for music and online classes and movies also
this is only for music lovers and call is optional it wont work after few days mine worked only for 1 week and im using this only for music it wont support for calling purpose mic wont work after few days
it is a very good product i used before boat 450in that sound loud 55 and clarity of vocals 375 and in this loudness 435 vocals 495 good headphones very comfortable compared to previous one used 3 hours per day and after 3 hours no pain but your ears will sweat best headphones under 2000rs
sound quality is good for its price range good built quality even call quality microphone is good i am using it with dual pairing with laptop for office meeting through skype and to hear music from mobile switching is there you cant hear both together i felt battery backup is quite good lasted more than 2 days almost 20hrs of intermittent use only drawback is not so comfortable for long hours max 3 hrs not because of continuous listening but ear started paining because of cusions
nice product amzing bass build quality is very nice over all nice product i love it
i will update the review after 1 monthfirst off all i want to say that its a great product super thumb bass bt actually that power we will get only by using bluetooth if we connected through wire there is some amount of soundloss and bass comparing with bluetooth connection the battery backup was really great i never get charged for 3 days bt it is still 90 its was really amazing i buy this product usually to play pubgits goodi had given only 4 stars because whe
the aux isnt too good i prefer using bluetooth with mobile since it gives better output bass is good according to price tag and noise cancellation is also satifactory design is really good looking and battery gives more time that company claims lol for my case atleast go for it
excellent battery backup good clear sound build quality is good at this price point not very rugged hence needs to be handled carefully these are initial impressions only long term update will follow only after 45 months of usage
for those who want bass dont purchase bass is not bad but is not super awesome sound quality is perfect very comfortable very nice design microphone is awesome battery backup is what i liked the most 2hrs of charging gives you 78 hrs of continous useoverall these are worth your money
battery backup is superb very good comfortability easy to wear good in looking
i loved the product amazing sound quality specially on bluetooth i have been using it for more than a year now only cons are1 after using it for an hour or so your ears my hurt because of the weight and build of this product2 i have been using it too much during the lockdown and the constant wear and remove action has peeled off its waterproofing plastic sheet from the headphone sponge so its no longer sweatproof3 its too big to wear and sleep if you like to sleep with your
after using it for a week i bought this to attend calls as started working from home charging was done only once in last week battery lasts for longsound clarity was awesome i had to do change some settings in laptop for micbluetooth is awesome only if you are on the straight path of your device otherwise there are disturbancesoverall good product to buy and am happy that flipkart delivered within 24hrs
hello everyone this is a awesome product for built and material quality sound quality is also good in most of the aspects but bass quality is not so good but it is good product to buy its over the ear and pads are very good and l could not feel of pain even wearing more than 2 hours continuously
giving reviews after using 15 days sound quality n bass is 5 out of 5best for gaming purpose built quality is reall good not as heavy as it looks noise cancellation in public is 4 out of 5consit pains a little after using it for half an hourwhen using the wire n answering a call ur voice cant react to the person at another side but while using bluetooth the problem is solvedits not good to carry while traveling bcoz its a little big if u ask me personally i would like to go
this is an incredible product by boat very good sound quality battery backup is fantastic and easily lasts about 10 hours for me

this is the best headphone in market and its price is very lowi bought it big billion day 1399 so its best to buy its battery back up is owsum about 8 to 10 hour easily i recommend this to buy whose looking about headphones
really a good product using every for 2 hrs ps last charged a week ago still working very well with good sound and bass not for gaming in pubg cause 1 second sound delay
it is best for listening party songs but not for romantic songsit feels more tighter on ears after applying for 1 hour rest is best
using it since last 3 months awesome product with great battery backup sound quality is great both for listening music and during calls you can buy this without any second doubt
it has good bass sound is well but no noise cancellation outside sounds are clearly heard no fm radio have aux connection port battery back up is ok zoook rocker ifit is great at 99900 with a drawback of low battery backup and no aux connection but have fm radio
i purchased it for 1399 on independence day salepros1passive voice cancellation i find it better than what i imagined2sound quality is upto the mark3bass is very good3battery backup is far better than they claim4 connectivity is goodcons1it is not that comfortable after using for 3 hours it causes pain i wish cushions would have been bit larger so that it can cover whole ear it actually rest on the ears which ultimately causes pain2design because of plastic
product is very good in design stylish and perform well excel in this kind of price segment superior sound clarity and extra bass is awesome

one of the best bluetooth headphones best quality sound and bass everything is just mindblowing best for gaming like for pubg mobile and pc
the product is good but it should have been lighter the biggest demerit is that the buttons volume pauseplay previous next doesnt work when playing with auxbut overall the product is good for this price rangei am satisfied
sound quality is superb bass is good too the audio cable is of bad quality you can hear the difference when it is connected to bluetooth and then using cable even though its first day i am experiencing pain in my left ear as i may have overused it 5hrs may be not quite used to it got it for 1399 super fast delivery within 18 hrs there is no better bluetooth wireless headphones at this price
as its review depicts bass quality of the headphone is good which i suppose to think it would have best but it is just satisfactory battery backup is splendid unbelievable superb whatever you may think so build is also good i love to use this
this is best headphone in this price range so farbass is too good that you can even experience a real bass woofer system with his headphonebattery backup is superb build quality is good a bit sporty look which makes it more cool awesome bluetooth connectivity just one thing is that there is a minimal sound leak but its fine when you have such a great sound and bass quality
good glossy design everything i love about it but at 80100 sound its audible clearly from outside
after i used it more then 15 days writing the review awesome battery back up up to 7 days after chargephenomenal design smooth clear sound quality value 4 money guaranteed

awesome sound quality best in class best in price amazing headphones for 1599
being a person who doesnt like very loud music it is absolutely perfect and i just loved the bass totally worth it for 1400 bucks if youre looking for bluetooth headphones go for it just one thing i felt that the aux cable is kind of cheap it keeps on getting disconnected while playing when aux is moved even slightly but on bluetooth it works flawlessly
the bass is awesome and earpads are comfortable i bought this one for gaming and its perfect for this purpose it has dynamic design and light weight giving you the confort if youre thinking about buying bt headphone ill recommend this one to you
i bought it for only pubg so many bluetooths are little bit slow 1 or 05 seconds when we playing pubg and mic didnt work properly but this one great for pubg and it will support 360 sound too i would strongly recommend for pubg lovers and gamers
after 3 days of use i can say its the best headphones you can get in this price range pros1 its sound quality is awesome 2 bass really is something on these headphones 3 battery life is best i have been using upto 3 days lightweight use and only 20 had drained 4 design is very cool its very modern now for the cons 1 the cups of these headphones are not very soft and will get uncomfortable after a long session 2 it has some latency will playing pubg but that can be solved by usin

the most amazing is that its battery is very good it is even more give backup than it says worth of money best headphone i have ever seen
the most recent of my buys from flipkart thanks for lightning fast delivery as promisedsimply the best decision i took when buying bluetooth headseti have been using bluetooth headset for almost few years now till now was using i ball which had clarity this time thought of trying boat rockerz 510 and one of the best decisions i madethe sound quality is absolute pleasure to hear and so is noise cancellation too didnt find any cons except that usb cable given is too short to plunge int
this is a very important review about this product1 the product dont work with wire2 the controls may not work properly specifically channel controlbefore buying know about sellers corseca wont replace the defective product theyll say u will be refunded time not specified cumbersome procedure sound is good with bluetooth if u dont want any controls to work if its just for sound like basic earphone u can buy this
let me explain you in detail from start to end the build quality no doubt in the prize which i bought just amazing the sound quality have 2 type of sound if you connected it with your phone then you will get very good sound with amazing bass and you will definitely love it but when you connect it with your computer through cable or bluetooth you will bit disappointed cause sound quality become weak but over all you will enjoy it battery 10hrs absolutely fantastic and enough for you
this is aon the ear headphone not over the ear headphone as shown in the specification highlights bass is awesome but it disturbs the vocalsso if u listen to music a lot this would helpbut watching movies and web series is not recommended using this producton the ear headphone makes head ache and pain in the outer earsbattery backup is awesome around 89 hrs also jack cable is available with this productnot recommended for long use but music lovers will find it amazing
this headphone is good but it realy disappointed me i am just telling my experiance over this headphone so its not mean that all these are correct i am lover of both music and games as a music loverevery one used to say that it has very great and extra puchu bass but it is not like that in fact boat rockerzz 400 and 225 s bass is far better than 510 it has only average level bass as a game lover there is sound lag while playing pubg by connecting it through bluetooth it really
after 3 months of use i am gonna list some pros and cons of this headphone pros are superb sound quality and bass awesome battery backup great design and control buttons plus wired mode which allows us to use it even when it is discharged cons are noise cancellation of the mice which is not that great and it also feels little heavy after long use
awsm headphones worth every penny super sound quality noise cancelation extra bass works fully it is an amazing product by boat battery backup is very good i have experienced it i ordered it in mid of may now also its battery is 70 design is also very cool i recommend to by the product it can connect with any device even iphones also thank you flipkart for giving discount on boat bluetooth headphones
cons 1 quality of the plastic used in the buttons on the side is not too good 2 sound clarity can be improved in my opinion it is the best wireless headphone under 2k
this headphone is super se ve upper and bass are amazing battery is very cool 55 yor show buy this headphone after1 day im order 1more boat rockerz 510 thanks flipkart
its a very good choice if you had bought it its gives very nice sound effects and very good valuable product it gives me realiastic experience with comfort
very nice headphone good for kids also value for money mic quality is best you should buy it thankyou
great headset the plus point is you can use it wireless and with wire in case of battery down not needed yet sound quality is good for listening music and in call super background noise removal overall good experience in firsy week use may review again sometime later
bass is great i would give it 5 out of 5 for bass and its pretty loud with some smartphones like realme or mi and not very loud with phone like oneplus 7t but sometimes there is distortion when its bluetooth is on and its battery i dont know why it goes from 90 to 70 percent and straight away from 70 percent to 30 percent and when it reaches 30 percent battery it beeps continuously after every 15 to 30 seconds when you listen music via aux there isnt much bass thats what i didnt like o
awesome product from boatsound is so good and also bass is goodbattery backup time is outstandingi fully charged it and after using it for 230 hrs it shows 90 batterybuild quality is very goodneck and ear cushions are so softif you want to buy on ear headphonesgo for it instead of any other headphones either they are from boat or other brandyou should buy boat rockerz 510 instead of boat rockerz 600these two has same features and also comforts but 600s cushions are soft than thi
very awesome product thank you flipcart i got it on my birthday it was like self gift to me very nice product i bought it for 2 reasons1st to play pubg clear footsteps commig 2nd for listening songs very excellent bass and sound quality is awesome and why cant i upload my pic with this comment i tried but failed to upload
amazing sound quality bass all so very good batterys very very nice totally product awsome really love it
these are the best headphones you can get for the price nice sound quality awesome bass and very long battery life makes these headphones really good however there is a bit of lag so while playing games you may switch to wired connection as aux cable is provided in the box mic quality is a bit less while using wired connection but is sufficient
nice headphone with nice bass with good battery life 8 hours continue song play full valume i liked it this is value of money product
this headset is a good headset i had seen ever it works always properly any error have never happened this headset have a good battery backup and charge remains very long it gave a good bass effect and good sound quality it is the right choice for persons who love sounds and thank you boat rockers for such a wonderful thing
descent headphone with pretty good build quality i have been using rhis for nearly 20 days and with an average usage time of 1hr a day i have charged them only once they came with full charge in the pack so battery back up is out of this world sound and bass experience is descent for this price range if you want a headphone with a affordable price and descent performance it is a must buy one
so far i have used sony sennheiser and jbl i was a little bit apprehensive about boat however after using it for a couple of days i freely admit that i am impressed no one can tell the difference of sound quality between boat and other market giants the price is also very much on the lower side comparing the similar products marketed by other famous brands all the switches are very conveniently placed works for quite a long time after one full charge no unnecessary noise disturbance
i am very happy with all the products of the boat brand i have ordered this headphones for the second time and this is the best music lover gadget in the market at the moment
good product very good battery very good sound effects and very good look
every penny you spent on this bad boy is worth it u will feel a clear sound with soft vibrating bass which is crystal clear nd the mic also gives clear audio outputjust go for it i m sure u will love itignore negative reviews use it for urself u will know the differencei hope this review might help u so give a like if it helps uor dislike it this doesnt help u totally upon youthank you
so far so good but quality fantastic like primium bass and stereo fantastic
i have been using this headset for atleast 1 week now sound quality is absolutely awesome but it sounds even better with the aux connected it can also be used as gaming headset i am basically using the rockerz for gaming purpose it has 360 surround sound which is basic necessity for gaming but battery backup is the best thing in this headset i charged it yesterday for the 1st time on an average i am using it for 5 hours a big thumsup to boat for making such a beast like headsets
honestly i was very excited to get this product at first but now after using it for about a month ive come up with this review1 sound quality is not excellent for anyone who loves to listen to songs on earphones that have rubber tips with good isolation but these are fairly cheap headphones too2 the whole thing about the thumping bass is a gigantic hoax im not sure if it has bass at all3 battery backup is good enough to keep you going for a day with average usage4 sound se
awesome headphone bote is the good choice headphone great sound quality is very good and bass quality is great
this is the best product which i bought ever from flipkart its sound quality is the best and powerful bass after 100 charging its standby time is approximately 600 hrs and playback time is approximate 30 hrs during this period
good music quality decent bass decent battery backup looks great manageable comfort on ear overall worth the price i paid 1699
great product but was expecting lill more design n battery backup is good very clear sound blue tooth range is quite ok easy operation for egular gadget user first time user may face problem to operate as no instruction manual is there great buy 1499 thanks to big billion sale
i never heard so many beats and sounds from the same songs that i used to listen before the first time i put them on i was blown away by the astonishing quality of the voice crystal clear sound that differentiates itself by its richness bass is adequate and is at the sweet spot anything more than that normally blows away the richness of the song it is punchy and deep battery backup is insane i bought them on 30th of august and i am writing this review on 14th september they are stil
bass is awesomethe music is clearly touching earsjust dont thinkbuy it and it will satisfy you passive voice cancellation is also good outside noice cannot even be heard4 stars for this headphone and 1 star for flipkart diliveryawesome headphone
awesome headphones suberb sound with a good bass and clear music the ear cushions really very smooth which doesnt hurt your ears after long usageoverall satisfied with this product purchased at this price
well i am not used to writing reviews but i always wanted toi bought this product by viewing many review videos on youtube and also searched throughout the internetthis product is great if you go by bass due to bass enrichment i believe it is sort ofnot so noticeable low in a trebleif you love ear shattering bass then take it it is loud and heavybass
if u searching best bluetooth headphone i believe till now this is the best when price is concern and forget about battery backup sound bass its really decent but only one thing u need to remember its little bigger in size as compared to size but we can manage it its not like bit heavy product
sound is not loud my expectations were high because there were many positive reviews but i really dont like it there r many cheaper and better headphones in the marketsound quality 3 5 build quality 25
i receive today this awesome product but my ear get pain some time but ok quality of product is good and comfortable to use and awesome sound quality bass is really good
color is vary goodi like blue color so i recive blue color onlyvary nice producti like it thank u flipkart
it looks cool and very attracted design but not so comfortable to use it suitable for travelers and gamerscant use for ordinary routine person those who are always wear on headphones while you choosing headphones think wisely how long u gonna use it on daily basis and what is ur requirements which one meet ur requirements choose that if you doesnt you will regret like me
this device is not supporting on honor phones i have honor play phone and this device is not supporting 3d sound in game or music
except battery backup nothing greatto be honest it not worth for the amount i spenti recommend t go with some good product with little more bucks
the product is amazing and best part of product is its dual mode you can enjoy gaming in wired mode gives an amazing experience and you can also enjoy other stuffs like music call on wireless mode if its battery is low you can also try wired mode
product is really good its sound quality is also goodbass is good but not as good as neckband but more than average noise cancellation works on high sound like u r teleportedbattery backup is amazing really go fr it with second thoughtonly problem is when u stop song or anything for few time it get switch off quickly ig its inbuilt functionrest assured its value fr money
i had been using this as my daily driver for more than 1 year pros 1 loud sound quality above 50 others can hear your song clearly 2 good battery backup more than 20 hrs continue usage 3 stirdy build quality i had dropped more than 5 times cons1bass is not upto the mark2sound distortion above 80 volume 3 i also have mi superbass its far more superior than this if you are a bass lover go for mi superbass or you want loud music go for this
flipkart delivered a day earlier than the promised dateas for the headphone when i used it for the first time it already had 80 battery charged and using it for an hour a day after three days now it is 70sound quality is better than other headphones ive used until now boosted bass theatre effects are very keenly noticeddesign is great this is bigger than i expected it cupped my ears perfectly but using it more than an hour causes slight pain in the outer ear since it pressures th
trust me its not that much good as they claimed you wont feel extra bass ever sound is ok only boat rocker 400 is much better then this
value for money product i am using it from last 67 months i am so much impressed with it buying rockerz 510 is worth it in every scenerio whether it is bass build quality everything is nice at this range of money
it looks great and the finishing is perfect but i have an issue of ear pain after using of 2 hrs i get little of ear pain and the super bass is good and the sound is too good worthy of buying dont think off buy it
im a gadget reviewee and my review for this overhear headset are below 1 all are fine but u could feel pain in ur ears if you wear it for like 30 mins or more2 if ur into melody or pleasant music you will feel less satisfied3 perfect for gaming and best for high beat music4 performs better than bluetooth modewhen connected using aux cable5 best for watching movies as even the little minute sounds could be heared6 it gives a whole dynamic experience while watching movies and p
its a beasti cant say everything herebut believe me its far better than jbl alsoi used both product but as per my choice i can definitely say that its far better than jblthe bass is extra ordinary and theres no lag while playing pubgso also good for gaming purposebut the one thing which is good in jbl which is the comfort levelyaa its not that much comfortable but yaa for 23 hours of usage there will be no issuesgo for it
review after 6 months works great soun quality is best battery backup is good but buttons are not syncing perfectly with my phone and exact amount of battery remaining is not showing it could be problem of my phone
i have been using sonys xb450 wired headset since 5 years believe me this does not come remotely close to the crisp and clear sound quality of sony i wont say its bad but dont expect too much from this device at this price its average product one i shall keep using as a backup i amgoing for another sony xb450
sound quality is very good at low volumes but not good at higher volumebass is goodissues while talking on calls our voice doesnt go clear and also less audibleoverall a good headphone but sound quality can be improved
i bought it after seeing many youtube reviews and also customer reviews so i bought it i was barely just satisfied with the sound quality as the people said the sound quality doesnt reach ur expectations but the bass is fabulous u wont expect the bass to be that loud the built quality is also good enough and battery backup is sufficient the studio and looks are great so i wont suggest u these headphones but these are good
it is a good product but its locks of earcups become loos in a few day bass is normal but as per specifications it extra bassuff it flash the earcups too heavyweight my ears are painting battery back up is good sound quality is good the filip kart not ready take any responsibility they are suggested to call sellers ufff it not good for any responsible company
best sound quality in this range bass ls little low but its ok design is very good cool looks best part is its battery backup
the best headphones with this much specifications its actual price on the box ie 4000 rs but you are getting such a beast at 2000 rs only first the good things about it1 great battery backup2 good quality build 3 great sound4 good looksthe bad things about it1 while connected to bluetooth some low cracking voices occur but they are very low and while playing games like pubg and codm etc the sound of firing with ads comes a bit latebut overall im satisfied with this purchase
excellent performance good stylish and comfortable to use good sound quality
been using for 3 year and it is good but aux cable and usb cable coming with the head set is trash both stopped working after one month but i liked headset really after one year there are some wear and tear and working fine if u are looking for a simple headset go for it
its just wow what a bettry backup sound bass m so happy thank you flipkart for such a wonderful product
the product is good at its price but as the said extra powerful bass that bass is not so as they said also my ears sweat a lot after wearing it but yeah good battery backup is good also the mic performs very well
