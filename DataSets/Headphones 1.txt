one of the best product i purchased from flipkart at such a decent price of1400inrin starting i thought it was bulky and cause ear pair but using it for a week i got use to this product with no problemgreat bassyou can hear the minor details great builtgo for it without giving it a second thought
i have tested this product and the sound quality is awesome and base if songs is good and battery back is also good this is one the best quality one
wonderful product great noise clearance awesome sound experience and the bass is good enough also it boosts up the bass in regions where theres low level bass and that was good although its a good productone thing i found out was about the size it covers most of ur ear if you have a moderate sized ear adding to the good deeds its light i weightoverall rating is goodenjoyed it a lot
very good product but not comfortable and good for callingmiq is not working like earphones miqbaki sab mast hsize is too big
great headphones but if u using 2 hr then yr ear getting hot but overall headset really nice from other headset like jblskullcandyi purchase only 1399
attention its wonderful voice is jus excellent and i am happy 100 compatible with apple comes with a lot of features trust me its an incredible which i ever used i strongly recommend it for u people go for it wireless and wired both
sound quality is best and better with wire and tha bass is very good high bass and bulid quality like h premium but the on the wireless with bluetooth the high volume sound in minimum distortion it is good for this price range i like it
one wordsuperb awesome sound quality and good built product i got it at 1399 which is a very fair price this
wow fantastic productthanks to flipkart neice and very clear sound deep good extra bass and sound effect look very neice and feel the light weight to wear the head phone
okay sonot going to write a detailed reviewheadphones are pretty goodno doubti have only 2 issues 1sound quality is average 2your ears will start paining after 1530 minsi dont even use it anymore because of the painmy ears turn red after 25 mins of usagethis headset gives a gaming look to youi wouldnt recommend this for music the bass is goodbut sound quality not up to the mark
worth every penny the only problm i am facing is the sweat all my ears but thats okay only when you are out office use works perfectly in ac no sweat overall i find it as a good purchase
its been a month now after i bought this if you are person who loves bass and listening songs in high volume this will drive you crazy it have way too good battery life like for 3 days i guess and gets charged even faster but if u listen songs in low volume this is not ur cup of tea also if u take it to gym it will definitely slip over your head and will make u uncomfortable prolonged use may make u feel uncomfortable in your ears and definitely big enough that u cant wear it an
excellent product works very well and its quality is excellent
amazing great sound quality bass is amazing battery backup is great but a little bit uncomfortable for 12 days but after that u will get used to
i believe this headphone is great if we talk in terms of battery great sound great bass great things that i would like to get better enough would be its ear cushions which are not that good connectivity options only 1 device can be connected at a time and also i believe bluetooth version in the headphones should be upgradedas a customer looking for under rs2000 wireless headphones they are great
the headphone is awesome with the correct audio quality i have been using this for 7 months now and finds it comfortable to wear and listen tooeven when the sound of the headphones is to the maximum the output is fantastic durability is also up to the mark i even slept with these on for a few days and i dont have any problem the keys are easily accessible once you get familiar with thosethe battery backup is also very good as i had to charge my headphones only during 3 to 4 days as i h
writing this review after 20 days usesound quality good at this price 45bass its good but not hard as my last jbl headphones but at this price i will give 45noise cancellation its good but not the best 35design awesome 55comfort i feel a bit irritation after 1 hour use 35battery never charged for first 15 days 1 hour regular use so 65
my expectations had high but its not coverd yet not a bad product its pretty good with sound and design as well the prize was little bit more compared to other same featured product
bluetooth is not identified in my laptopand when i connect to my phone wifi only i can able to listen music but when i am trying to call the sound is not clear and the voice is not coming clear i tried with various phones so the sound is not clear during the call you can say the voice of the call is not clear enough to understand
the headphones are very awrsome because it has a crystal clear sound in listening music as well as in call the mic is also of good quality bass is awesome the aux which they give in the box is flatcablebattery backup is very very longlasting and even if it finishes you can use aux the only thing i hate is this headphones are not foldable or rotatable
this product is awesome in sound build quality as well as bass its a good product in this price range but its a bit big and not foldable which are the cons of this device overall a good product and worth the money
this is just awesome great features powerful bass with good sound quality awesome as well as beautiful product
its sound feel good in ear and no headache or migraine problem not happened after 3 hour of use it is solid built up but after long use you may feel some pain on the outer portions of your ear but overall product is good and very dashing looks and kudos to flip kart for timely delivery
first of all nice comfy beautiful looking for green lovers sound and bass quality is awesome and also battery backup
awesome purchasepros best sound quality and bass good battery backupcons if you wear 4050 minute continious then you will feel pain in ear head cusion is not good as ear one
this product worth money at this price segment this is one of the best bluetooth headphones available i use it for watching movies listening songs i liked it and recommend others also to buy this if interestedalso it has an amazing feature to connect to two devices at the same time to do this turn the headphones on while holding the volume up button and now you can connect to 2 devices simultaneously
what can i tell yougo for this product without any doubt base and sound quality can vary with mobile i have coolpad zenfone 5z and mi note 6 pro sound quality is best in 5z and 6 prowith and without aux but satisfactory in coolpadwithout aux also base quality with aux base quality without aux by the way i am completely satisfied with its performance considering its price segment
these headphonesboat never disappointsthis is my second boat headphone and the sound quality it has is just amazing plus the battery life you get is just great i would say if you want good sound and bass quality you go boat the design is great the only thing that bothers me is that it cant be folded as my earlier boat 400 was foldable and easy to fit in my bagtrust it occupies space but still i am loving this boat headphones are more than value for money
omg what a mindblowing bass cant explain overall best at this price build quality is good but may broke battery backup is very impressive bluetooth and mic is also good

sound bass and battery backup is too good like charge once and forget to charge again when you play music louder peoples standingsitting near you can hear it charged the battery on 7th april and using 34hrs daily after 13 days it shows battery 30 and running i think you have to charge it once in a month as it has the best battery backup

after using a week or more i am giving this reviewover all in this price segment a must buy wirelss headphone by boatso let me give you some details about itbattery backup is best almost more than a day as a daily usage music gaming movieand all and the charging is also goodit shows on your smartphone the percentagered light means offblue lights means onthe bass is good but not bestcalling is also goodsound quality is also good only one problem in full volume both your phone an
nice product with good sound qualitynice product at 1800bass is not so good as expected but the overall volume balance is quite good and gets you the minute details
i give 5 starssound and base are well balanced to both sidesdo buy boat aux cable as provided aux with headphones are not good and it decreases the sound badlygo for it
its really a good headset not just in mobile phones also in laptops and tabs im using it for 7 days back to back still battery isnt dead i suggest everyone to buy this i know its a little bit expensive but its totally worth it thank you flipkart
i awaited 2 months to buy this product as we all do i did lots of research in this headphone and went twice in every positive and negative comments my point is its really good this budget but really amazed thanks one more thing i would like to let u know is this the usb cable provided by co is not so good but overall u can buy it
writing this review after using it more then 4 months these headphones is really great i use this for my gym daily and day to day music the best this about this is its battery backup and sound i charge this once a week my daily usage is for 2 to 2 and a half hours my friends and people really loved this headphone some said they even have used higher range headphones of 7k brands like soni those even dont have this much bass and great sound it was best decision to purchase this hea
after three days of usage sound quality is crystal clear decent bass and good surround soundbut most importantly this headset doesnt work well with bluetooth 50if connected with bluetooth 50 sound cracks with poweramp and play music works well with gaana and pubgno crack effect with aux cable connectedbut again with aux connected mic performance is terribleat this price this product is goodbut i would suggest to go for jbl bluetooth headset which supports bluetooth 50
sanjeev very good sound qualityclarity is very fine also bass is too good battery backup is average built is little big could have been slim and compact overall very good for music lover go for it its worth buying
i have received the red color boat rockerz 510 i must say this has worth the price sound clarity and quality you can feel the bass with minimal sound distortions at high volumes battery backup is excellent mic quality is good but it ends up capturing background noises like that of fan or traffic horns etc which maybe a little irritating for the listener on the other side comfort wise i wouldnt say this is very good ears start paining after an hour or so also cannot adjust or move th
it has a very good battery backupits design is like it shows that it is made up of plastic or too over stylishbut although everything is awesome
every thing is fine and look wise awesome but if u using for long time your ear may pain other wise awesome go for it no doubt
very very very superb product for this price ilove this bace is good treble is good sound quality is very very good
have been using this since 3 months and very happy with the sound quality and product quality delivery was on time and got it at a good deal overall happy with the product
buy it and plug into nirvana the only disadvantage is that it cannot be rotated but it looks cool and bit fancy in public good for playing pubg and all i will give 10 on 10 at quality and battery backup 810 on sound 9 10 on design and 610 on portability
very nice gadget like the shape ncstyle and sound connectivity have no issues and music sounds great overall a good product to carry battery is fine too
great headphones compared to the other available at this price best thing is that you can use them with both bluetooth or aux cable too but my aux stopped working after 3 months of useits just the size of headphones are too big atleast for me but depends from person to persononly one complaint it does not show the battery status properly in the mobile just show 90 of battery left even just before battery dies overall a good purchase
awesome sound quality extra bass makes super awesome lovely finsh touch really loving it but just little hard the ear couson are
product is good along with its battery life if you are searching for a good product then maybe this is the one i am not saying it has very good bass it has a very normal bass design is awesome its a good product go for it
had to set the volume to high with phone for best soundvery big for small headsound is clear and goodthats why i love boat
best headset within 2000 i gifted this to my friend he loved itbut only one problem he had to change his headphone before receiving calls as the voice is not clear but his voice is clear and loud in games
excellent battery backup it is good thing in this prize good looking cool
yes i find out this product have so many potential this product sound is really fun bass full and very entertaining design is really good according to me and sound quality is very good but if we you on full volume the the base of this headphone bass is really huye headphone is not very comfortable after one hour or one and half hour you will find very uncomfortable
sound quality is good but not awesomemic sound is not appropriate or u can say mic sound is very less when used for calls and gaming activities battery sustainability is very impressive i must give one extra star for itoverall the product is good but it needs some improvements in various areas
these headset is seriously a mind blowing deal amazing sound quality and all the features are superb and i must say its battery backup is superb great work by boat
in this headphone battry backup is soo good and sound quality is very awesome i am really happy with this product
this is a very good quality earphones sound is awesome and bass uff not to say more very few types of headsets are made i loved it very much
awesome build qualitysound is up to markbest buy according to price those looking for a durable companion should buy it without any doubt its very good but not the best
after using this for 1 week and battery still not down must say product is good build quality should have been better than good sound quality is good in case of music and call respectively bass is also good one shortcoming though is as it bulid of plastic material when listening to music on full volume others can hear it i think its because of the powerful drivers to sum it up overall good product and one should go for it
best product i prefer everyone to buy this if you are interested in headphone and this is the best among all products with best price
superb headset it feels tight on first two days of its usage later you feel very comfortable with it superb sound quality go for it
this is an awesome product from boat and with the offer price its a real steal a bit dissapointed with the charging cable quality but any common microusb charging cable will work fine with it good battery life and fast charging mic is fine if not the best i am so satisfied with this product that after using for almost a month i have bought another one for my wife
superb build quality simply amazing sound quality rich bass what else you want in just 2000 buckshighlight and best part of this headphone is that you can use it via aux cable when running out of power and the quality of sound is equally same as wireless so dont search anything else just go for it
this is an excellent product for music lovers the quality of sound and bass is amazing the deal that i got from flipkart was also brilliant and delivery timelines are pretty smooth additional 6th star for the design of this amazing headphone talking about the battery back up its very decent if you have a use of around 3 hours a day then the bettery can last for 56 days compatibility and comfort though the cushons are good and fit well on your ears but this might trouble you if
see bought this after reviewing so many youtubers video and products really amazing just facing problem during calls voice break not had good experience during calls but at music and videos playback well connected with perfect sound quality within 1015 feet i am using with my redmi note 3 and hp folio 9470m i5 3427u call quality extremely bad music and video smoothly going well
damn cool and sexy product sound quality is good pretty good body don t use it while boxing or any sort of exercisebcoz it isn t sweat proof if you just wanna relax listening to music then go for it
amazing battery life good sound quality only thing that is not good is sound comes out and clearly audible when volume is high or little more than average
the best headphones i ever bought trust me i have bought many the sound quality is perfect with the exact bassits completely adjustable which makes it a must a buy product battery is long lasting when connected to phone via bluetooth displays the charge left in the headphones which makes it easy to know the charge available before going somewhere rather than ascertaining it is scratch proof also i mean minor natural scratches dont try blades or any other sharp objects to test it
best headphones at this range strongly recommend good sound quality in love with this product
value for money good for regular use as it is not soo costly but if you a true music lover then we have better products but this is good for daily use sound good bass not soo good
it is worth every single penny i bougth it on advise pf my friend it didnt dispoint me at allexcellent sound quality nice comfort and a great designsuperb
this product is very very bassful and awesome audio effect and it feels like we are in a sunburn festival or at goa beach trance music all the way i really attach it and in the flight alsoi really really love it and also want to give my support and whole life rating as highreacher
sound quality is good bass is recognizable but the design could have been better its bullky to carry around but comfort wise it can be worn for 34 hours continuously the battery backup is the most amazing it lasts long that u forgot when did u last charged it the aux cable helps you to be flexible regarding the connectivity to the devices without bluetooth overall its worth for its price i bought this for rs1500 three months back
boat speakers and headphones are usually best this one is at par bass is good along with sound quality build quality is nice and durable battery back up is good with fast charging lasts for almost 1012 hours worth every penny one must go if not brand freak
its sound plus its bass are quiet good and to add more to that it design is superb a very nice mid range headphones by boat
its beast in this price range i bought it for 1799 price always varies headphone is good to hear music playing gamesit is only handy when we using less hours after an hour usage ears are bit hurtingit would be great if we get same variant in over ear modeloverall satisfied with product
very good sound quality and very good bass quality is very good thank you for flipkart rs 1900 battery backup very good
nice headset under this price great sound quality and noice cancellation works pretty well good calling experience you can control your calls and music directly from the buttons provided on the headset must buy
so first thing first you cannot return this product only replacement is possible2nd thing is that the person who is sitting near you can easily listen what your are listening so it is like speaker everyone around you can enjoy same music3rd little bit uncomfortable you will feel weight over your ears after some timebut sound and bass quality is good that is why 3 star and i am still in confusion that how this product got 4 and above ratingif you love your privacy shouldnt go for it
its looks too cool also fabulous but bass is too much i love it thanks for this
great headphones if you are a bass lover than blindly go for itears starts paining after some time but this normal every headphones have this problem not a great issue if this headphones had fold option than there would be no other headphones better than this in 5000 segment guarantee
just go for it very good sound and bass not sure about build quality used only for 10 days but as of now looks very strong good bluetooth connectivity and good mic bit tight and ears start paining after 1 hour of usage and becomes difficult after 2 3 hours bought for 1699 on flipkart sale
amazing product sound quality is next level and the best part is the bass one thing i didnt like is the cushion it hurts a bit but the whole product is worth the orice
so nice clear sound and fabulous bass love its this product thnqq
sound and bass quality are quite good but design of overhead is not familiar sometimes causing headaches and body heating around ears i think it useful in travel in chair car position not suitable for sleeper position use without having nice cushion or well stuffed pillow i will rate this 45 for value for money with bluetooth and plug in type model and aesthetic looks
decent head phone with decent sound bass is real good but sharpness is not that clear however for the price its real good design is awesome and looks very stylish
awesome product with superb features and it works better than as i expected especially the battery backup its just excellent fir for battery and bass i would definitely give it 1110if you are thinking about the headphones then you will definitely miss it go blindly
superb product amazing and clear sound and bass is cool vibrate in ur eardesign is good quality this headphone dnt hurt ur ear comfortable cushion
very nice and super sound quality by boat at a rate of 1500 purchased during diwali sale very friendly and nice headphones
awesome product best headphones under 2000 dont see just buy because it is beat for travelling best for gaming like pubgrosetc
good one connect using bluetooth to enjoy better sound qualityvia aux cable you hear music like lifeless it never let air inside or outside your ears sometimes you feel like cookingsweating inside
great sound easy connectivity the pricing is also very competitive do not compare it with other foreign brands like jbl and sennheiser boat rockers lives to its expectations
awsm product best in sound quality best battery backup love u flipcart for this beautiful product
sound quality great 5 star bass awesome 5 star battery backup amazing 5 stari bought in rs1799all is good but after 30min pain in the earoverall 4 star
just go for it its best in this price range believe me sound quality is just great and everything is excellent only cons is its build quality its not as good but manageable
anybody who has owned sony jbl or sennheiser headphones earlier will be slightly disappointed the sound is considerably good but the bass sound clarity are different for different songs though ripped at exactly the same kbps 320 in my case the sound of instruments and vocals get mushy and mixed up the bluetooth in these headphones has a limited range its only constantly connected if you put yr phone on a holder when riding a bicycle or wrap it around your arm when jogging otherwise t
good sound good quality good option in this price range totally value for money comfort level awesome
first of all the look of this headset is just amazing a fully robotic look by saying in one word according to its look its colour combination of black and red its sound quality and also about the battery backup it is just a blast second thing that the combination of red and black colour of this headset is super and in third number the sound quality of this headphone is very powerfull and the baas quality of this headphone is just a big blast that means it gives you a very high quality
great headphones they r the best but not good long term use battery backup is exceptional loved it
awesome sound level and great quality god level bass i m very happy great delivery by ekart definitely go for it its 100 value for money
good build with an eye catching coloureasy to pair up and has a good rangeand as far as the sound quality is concerned it is one of the best headphones in the market5 stars for boat
owssome very clear sound good battery backup nice basssss good choice for base lovers
pretty good product good when you buy it during sales 1500 is good deal
awesome product good quality and perfect sound loved it
pros awwwful bass best battery backup best in design cons use of more than a hour ears pain and its not comfortable while running or doing gym
pros 1 i wont talk abt bass cz its amazing really thumping bass 2 backup is good lasts nearly 12hrs for me 3 design and build quality okay but not great it should be better 4 headset will turn off automatically after 10m after disconnecting from bluetooth only 5 additional plus point is wired jack useful when battery dies cons 1 biggest con is cushions are not comfortable at all to me and ears get lot of paining after 10m of listen for me i dont hw other feels
great battery life good product good sound quality and of course great bass
sound is good but bass is not enoughi would rather recommend go for 400 versionit has good deep bass soundbattery backup is excellent
awesome bass and clear soundthe best headphones in this price range only con is it is not foldablebuild quality is also good
nice product long battery backup stylish excellent bass sound is no tearing at higher volume if you want to purchase go for it
in past i bought severel headphones but no one is good in terms of sounds as compared to this headphones deeply pure bass good battery back up everything is perfectly good almost bang for buck
very good product from boat sound is very good and bass is awesomei am satisfied with the product design build quality and sound as well
this product so good and and so cool sound just awesome and battery pickup so good
beautiful experience both on listening pleasure as well as musical precision great feel on your ears
very much impressed with boat it is not totally soundproof but yes it is a good deal i purchased for 1500 so i am satisfied with it
better than expected good sound quality good bass good battery life best at this price range
it is the most amazing product purchased by me online great design great build amazing soundbass got it for just 1400 on sale couldnt have asked for something better great value for money product battery backup is the best
good battery backup and built quality sound quality is really good i must say bass is good if the song quality is high or depending on d songs little bit heavy big
very nice product with good sound and bass connectivity is good and also the make of the product is nice worth buying
awesome sound quality superb bass nice build quality battery backup have to checknice looks proper packing
worth for moneyboth connectivity has pros n consin bluetooth bass is quite less than wired hands free buttons are workingin wired handsfree buttons are not working but sound is really good in wired mode
has a very clear sounds which allows you to hear even faint background music the bass is good not to powerful but still acceptable has a very good battery backup i received upto 1112 hours great product
good design and quality of sound completed cover the ear on ear typelight indication for on and off not sound like boat rockers 400 finally happy but if folding is also present then its easy to carry it without damage
excellent sound very comfortable light weight sound quality is great love it so much built quality is excellent and so so much to write
after using this product for 10 days i found this product is a awesome one battery backup is excellent after using for 10 days around 2 hour a day only 70 percent of battery is discharged sound quality is good bass is also good but that could be better bluetooth range is also good hope this will help u thank u
the headphones have a great bass and the battery capacity is enough if you use the headphone for a week 2 hrs a day the headphones are great for gaming purpose the built quality could have been better thumbs up from my side
these are great headphones with good sound clarity and adequate bass the only thing which i found bothersome are the keys on the right side which are a bit loose and creates a buzzing sound when tracks with heavy bass are being played overall the product has a nice built quality offers quick connectivity and is worth the money
this is good for gaming but not for songs bcz the the deepness which need for a song is missing in this headset but the battery back up is osm and osm built quality is good and sound is clear and mic is just awesome
an excellent product from boat loved it amazing sound quality great looks
flipkart took 11 days to deliver the headphone not expected about the headphone its nice good build quality nice sound quality and also good battery life go for it
at this price i think its one of the best probably the best product you can havethe sound quality is pretty awesome base is also good more of all the price tag is awesome
the delivery was excellent and the boat quality is best all around the world so i give it 5 star all efforts are are good
amazing product really in love with this headphone bass is just awesome and as mantioned about crystal clear sound its really crystal clear
not worth the money very low bass but comfortable rockers 410 is better than this one in terms of bass but the comfort youll not get there this one has a better microphone than the 410 so if you need better sound experience go for 410 if you need comfort and a good mic go for this one you cannot fold this also which you can in 410
should work on good colours as all choices available look really bad plus its not very easy to fit and gives some pain after long use the best thing about it is its battery backup using it daily for at least an hour for last one week but dont need to charge it yet the sound quality is okay types if you are very particular about sound and bass then avoid it but you cant expect much in this price range as well
i got it in 1499 i am mad sure that i cant get better headphones than it in this price range although its not foldable but its plastic looks premium and very long lasting sound quality and clarity is also very good so why do you think more open flipkart and order it it s my 2nd gf also it will impress you after using a month i am reviewing 1in this price range none can beat its battery life 2its thumpin
really good headphonespros1 the battery never dies even after a week2 good bass provided your device has good bass settings3 has hd sound and its crystal clear4 good for considerable usage5 the bluetooth 41 connection is strong and superb6 comfortable ear cupscons1 the design seems quite fragile though2 upon long hour usage it might give you slight discomfort on your ears but thats ok
product is awesome with amazing sound quality battery backup is very good as of now should wait and see if you he same performance continues
amazing lookgreat soundhigh quality basseverything is great except its ear cuffs its not in proper shape and somewhat bigger than normal headphones otherwise look is fantasticbut u cant wear it more than 30 min orelse ear hurts
im writing this review after using it for more than a monthbefore using product i have used sennheiser cx 275s headphone in the market if there is any product in this price range who can give a tough fight to the giant sennheiser brand is one and only boatbasically it is a overhead phone with the big size which will cover your ear completely initially if you feel uneasy with this product please do not giveup you will feel it comfortable after 23 dayssound quality of this produc
i purchased this product on big billion day sale but i have had my eyes on it from quite a while it reached to me today morning and guess what loved it i had been using boat earphones of my friend and when i was completely satisfied with the brand i decided to go for more products of boat and that is when i set my eyes on rockerz 510 for the first time i have been listening songs in it for a few hours now and i absolutely love it i hope it continues to be as incredible in upcoming days
oh man seriously are you kidding me unbeatable at such price tag a complete beast being a professional singer im very concious choosing bass in headphones my search ends on this product my fav headphone company boat now onwards loving it
nice headphonesuper base rocking stylem really impressed with this headphonebut main reason is its mike not works properly in calling the receive end not receive my voice properly intrupt voice
headphone is awesome in this price budget its sweat lil bit but quite manageble if you feel beat then listen from your music app and in youtube sounds get lil differ but decent actually depends on music type also bluetooth quite good both in music and voicecalling if you have this price range i will suggest just go for it no regrets
the most recommended just buy it im writing this review now 26 tuesday on november 2019 it is the most and best recommended headphone dont give it a second thought just buy it and not forgot to say this is best for pubg
nice headphone good sound quality and bass was awesome battery is also nice it works 4 to 5 hours if we use it continuously
the best product i like it i love flipkart best thank you flipkart
trendy look lightweight good battery crystal clear sound and great bass perfect buy for under 2k
it has been a superb device i love it the build quality is wonderful sound is awesome and its very easy to use all and all a good buy
awesome product worth buying for the price bass effect is mind blowingbass lovers i suggest this product with no second thought in mindboat at its best quality
pros 1 superb bass quality not less than that of a bosebeats headphones2 calling with this headphone is a delight3 crisp and clear sound with perfect treble4 very comfortable5 battery backup is great and recharges pretty quick6 got this for 1499 during sale cant get better than this at this pricecons 1 not quite portable should have come with a carry bagpouch2 buttons are a bit confusing however we can get used to it after sometime
1build quality is very very good at this price range2sound is low if you are a sound and bass lover this headphone should be your 3rd opinion 3 bass is low but average4battery back up is good if you use it multiple in a day it is battery backup is nice but if you use heavily in a day this should be your 3 rd opinion
bass is good melody is good battery is too good but if there was foldable cups then it will be great anyway i love iti loved the battery backup its lasts for a whole weekbut its earcups are not that soft
amazing headset it fits so well i can dance wearing it sound and bass is tooo good when i play song in it i get the feel of dj party good and best product
the ease of connectivity and power backup are awesome but the headphone kind of slips off if u bend a little or tilt ur head meaning the grip over head is not the best sound quality at this price range is pretty good one good thing is that if the charging runs out u can always connect by wire and listen to music
this headphone is awesome its price the battery back is good and you can be carefree of battery as you get an aux cable with it through which u can connect it through phone and listen to music when battery runs out the buttons on side are so helpful that you dont have to take out your phone the range of bluetooth is also great it has comfortable earbuds the only problem may be little with the loosening of headset and it may fall of your head if you are not careful
sound is not that great which you get in in ear type earphones if you have ever used boat bass heads 225 super extraaa bass earphone or sony mdrex150 then you will definitely get very disappointed with this headphone it looks really good but a bit bulky go for bluedio t2 plus in this price segment that one is far better than boat rockerz 510 battery back up is decent i got this headphone in flipkart big billion days at just 1399 inr so it didnt effect me much thats why instead o
battery and sound quality is awesome build quality is not so superior as plastic feel is very much evident on the body and buttons but overall a good product with comfortable ear cups and output got it for 1499 definitely worth it for 1500 waited for almost 3 months feels a bit sweaty after wearing for long but otherwise no issues wearing for long
itz an amazing product i have got i needs it for studies from you tube and when it delivered to me it really helps because it has excellent sound quality if any body want to buy it dont think just order and i would like to thank flipkart for delivering me this product on time but there is one thing which disappoint me about that packing was not good once again thnx flipkart
nice headset for its price tag of 1999 i got it for 1750 vocals are pretty much clear bass is on an average headphones are suitable for casual use but if you are a professional musician then go for something around 10000 bucksfit and finish is good fitting can vary from person to person due to different head size a little bit of glitch sometimes when using through bluetooth otherwise loud enough for enjoying any type of music dont compare this headset with an
i will recommend u should go for this headphone trust me it gives very good sound with extra bass and its very comfortable its long battery will help you to be entertained for long journeys
nice design nd attractive look and good bass or sound is really good
it has nice sound quality and bass is awesome nican use wireless as well as by using wire battery is also long lasting overall its worth for money
awesome product charge remains for a great period of time and the bass quality is awesome and good for gaming too just a lil prblm that it hurts after prolonged use which is common as it is a extra bass bluetooth headphone overall awesome product go for it
excellent sound quality with a good bass at this price boat rockerz is unbeatable for a decent sound quality at a lower cost overall satisfied
this headphone is for bass lovers vocals and highs are well balanced you can hear edm rock jazz the headphone has veey good vibrations for heavy bass and i have tested for extreme bass and i loved this headphone passive noise cancellation is good i will ratebass 1010vocals 910highs 1010build for heavy extreme listeners build for loud music 50mm driver makes u feel good sound build quality is 610
bass breathing dragons hands down the best headphone at this price if you have bass hungry ears great sound quality but the highs are not the best good build quality but the cushions on head potion is kinda itchy and the top panel part feels like cheap plastic but considering the price its okay they are also a bit heavy maybe its because of the big battery which takes me to the battery life the battery on this lasts for 2 weeks with 23 hrs of daily usag
sound quality is awesome at 1500 rs bass is excellent has a quite really thumping bass battery back up is excellent cannot twist has a fixed structure hence when it is rested on neck you can turn your neck around it is not at all comfortable for continuous hours of usage ears pain that is natural as it is over the ears even though i am giving only 3 stars it is paisa wasool for the money ive given
good sound output and look of the product attractive packaging ideal for giftingslightly oversized though good power back upsatisfied with performance and price combination
its awesome classy look n performance is simply superb beyond expectations thnx flipkart for timely delivery of the product love u boat
best bass gives the thumping effect when turned to full volume long battery life good connectivity if you are looking to buy headphones definitely go for this best headphones love it
all i wanna say is that this headphones are pretty awesome really cool looking and the bass i really love itthe bass is really superb
best thing is fastest delivery of flipkart product is very good but it is somehow bulky and material shouod be more durable afterall best product
one of the best product ever suitable for anyone and everyone worth of money good sound good quality mic is working well and nice so you will enjoy after purchasing it
it is the best product in this prize range bass treble and audio base is just perfect just keep in mind that this headphone is not for continuos use more than 1 hourfitting is good
as per my requirements that sounds should blast and at the same time being crisp so that each instrumental detail and magic wont fade away in front of the singers voice each required bass drop and hike is superbly covered each instrumental voice from the thumping drum to the melodious flute can be identically recognized and sink in the heart directly as human nature we always want more the only thing bothering is all the great experience is there until you are using the wireless mod
edited my review after use of 1 monthita stil just amazingthe power juice you get with these headsets is amazing they 10hrs but actually i didnt charger them for 2 3 days they still keep on working my average usage is 2 to 3 hrs a day and the sound quality is just amazing the feel of music and bass are no other words for them they come with aux cable thats also is of good quality and the music remains same on aux and bluetooth
a good buy sound clarity is nice and prefect for those who like to feel the beats making the product excellent for indoor use but the issue is the sound masking in high noise environment the set loses its efficiency and maxing out the volume wont give you the desired effect as the super bass will be to much to handle for the ears to sum it up a perfect set for indoor and low noise environment
best better performance and battery back up truly genuine product my decision is super
product quality is great sound is great everything is great just the earpads are not that much confortbleafter a long use ears will feel some pain
full review after using 1 year and 6 months it says extra bass truly its real you can hear the vibration of the soundnow pros 1super extra bassincluding vibration 2 sound quality is awsome 3 build quality is great 4 battery back up is great now cons 1 its tough to wear it continuously 23 hours 4 the driver size is little bit small im not complaining it but if it becomes big it would be better otherwise go for it strongly recommended dont compare this wi
the product is awesome as like said xtraa powerfull bass love this thank you boat for this wonderful product
fantastic product at best price no any issues no any fault it covers whole ear awesome mind blowing bass clear audio nothing waste of money must buy it fully satisfied and enjoying
quite good i have been using this since 2 weeks now no issues this far but do get connection problems sometimes the bluetooth connection range is low but the sound level and the bass almost covers up for it music control keys work fine quite comfortable to wear although havent used it for more than half n hour continuously the headphone overall looks decent too the best part of this is definitely the bass
nice sound quality with very good bass looks and feels good and above all very comfortable to wear you can wear it for hours without any problem highly recommended
it is really an awesome product the bass of the headphone is just wooow it is probably one of the best wireless headphones i suggest you to buy it all the best
reduced one star for sound clarity and discomfort that occurs on long wear bass is as per promise pretty handy to use and attending phone calls is great with great clarity and finally flipkart delivery reached me 3 days prior to expected time ordered on sat received on tuesday thank u flipkart
