the best poduct that i bought from flifkart it works superb like ac and price is also reasonable only rs 8698
cooler is big and wide maharaja brand trust y every thing is good about cooler create less noise only thing is that its motor is not powerful even in high speed rest all things are good but yes for one middle size room it is ok
it is one of the best air coolers at reasonable price have ever seen but the ventilation of the room is must for proper cooling but the size is quite big it will i hope create a space problem during off seasons the air supply is very good and its one of the essential part of the air cooler with the wool wood pads which helps to make super cooling afterall thank you maharaja company to make such a product in affordable and reasonable price
awesome air cooleri was looking for a cooler under this range and this has fulfilled my requirement this has the following features1 great air through the capacity of 5000 m3hr 2 comes with a large 65litre tank which can run overnight with ease3 great built that is a shockproof and reliable material4 you have to stop this beast at night because it has that massive cooling capabilityone small concern is mine and it is for sure that it is not a dealbreaker that it produces s
purchased after a lot of discussions and reviews i would say this the best which gives you the comfort needed best to for with no 2nd thoughts nice cooling low noise hope this should be energy efficient and used for a long run
very nice cooler cooling is very good there is no noise i reviewed a lot then only i purchased it if you want effective cooling you have to set it up at a window where there is cross ventilation without cross ventilation it will make environment humid lookwise it is very nice and material is strong
feedback given after using one week the cooler is amazing its making the whole room cooling you should install the cooler near to your windows the delivery was on time as well the delivery boy also very supportive
great deal 65 l quite big tank sufficient cooling for one medium size room 3 modes works well best in this range
i bought this cooler on heavy discount by flipkart cooler is build of good quality material it has a fast fan with powerfull motor pump air quality is excellent even for a big room a must buy value for money product
the good things1 very well packed good amount of thermocols to protect from transport damages2 sturdy body3 relatively less noise as compared to bajaj cooler i had earlierwish this was betterfor many purposes it is necessary to open cooler body opening the body of cooler is not very intuitive common consumers may not even attempt for fear of damaging something 1 easy opening of side frames to change pads or clean the water inlets2 water balloon used to cut water supply au
excellent producthappy with resultnice air flowosm cooling
cooler works fine and it is inverter friendly
small wire and moter capacity is very low fan speed was not good out flow vent hole is above the lower part of cooler its very difficult to change water
perfect product for large size room
average cooling not much as expected by size and reviews of cooler cooling is sufficient maharaja whiteline should work on its cooling efficiency and reduce size by width can increase in height to maintain tank capacity
product was amazing cooling capacity awsum pls go for ahead a big thumbs up
good
received dalay 10 days cooler is ok when i was reveived switch damaged
big oneworking good 2days of use hope will work for long run

very impressive coolerpros stylish energy efficient 165 watt very good air throw and cooling summersible pumpcons very bulky take more place than other no wheel lack of ice box
best cooler i bought 6884
excellent cooler in this price rangepros1 air throw is very powerful even when u run it at slow speed setting 2 cooling and tank capacity3 ergonomics cons1 if you want to clean the cooler then opening the pads is very cumbersome process if you have placed it on some flat surface then also draining the old water is very difficult overall v good cooler apart from above cons and considering price
cooler not provide cool air because 1year experience
a good product in budget
packaging excellent value for money product
delivered within 2 days working good
efficient for large roomspros1 low noise of fan2 inverter friendly3 cools large rooms fastly and easily4 it have aroma chamber in which you can add tablet of frangrance to counter smell of woodwool pads5 it have 2 section for air flow which means you can adjust it to get air for double decker cot equallycons1they should have provided stand of castor wheel for it to move2 it should have ice chamberwill update more about it in future
better than the steel cooler less noise and value for money
dont buy maharaja whiteline coolers they have cheap aluminum motors that are good for at max 2 years repair cost of these motors is so high that u would want to sell rather than repair them
very nice product and delivery is satisfied
no quality product1 the wood wool has started falling out from the next day2 out of two led indicator has found not working on arrival3 the air swinger is already giving noise when moving which never used to be in my old cooler which i am using since 3 years4 the quality is no way machine to branded coolers5 anti bacterial tank has been bacterial now as there is no way to clean it so congested to maintain it cleanlyin my way think before you buyac has option to aut

dont buy just by seing the comments dont know how people review and rate the product cooling is ok but when it comes to fill the water you would need inlet pipe to fill the water we cannot open from the backsides to fill the watercleaning is highly impossible because there is no way you can open and clean worst design other small small branded companies provide all those facilities but this is worst product design totally unhappy with this product

cooler chilled the room very fast
its good but size is too big
its huge and secondly its as good as ac but the problem is you cannot control the cooling its good if you have a 1500 sqft house
it is perfect for your daughter marriage items no doubt it is big and it is room cooler
amazing product it works wonders in 45c and always go for wood woolen pads as theyre better than honeycomb
very good product dont think much more go for it absolutely value of money
it is big moving it is problematic it would have been easier to clean if the side panels were easily removable does a decent job of cooling the room
good product

simple super
good product
working great three side cooling pad has increased its efficiency the fan speed and airflow amount could be better it is very difficult to put water from the front a lot of design flaws but at this price point its better than other brand products for optimal comfort and cooling the cooler needs to put outside the room in an open space or near the window of a wellventilated room
awesome product if possible pls provide wheel stand with product
good product the only draw back is there is no space for putting ice
unable to open to change water or grass
nice product with good blower and fast cooling a real satisfaction for money
dont buy any one

cooler is good but size is very bigand trolley are not provided
very smoothgood product
if you can provide trolley wheels stand along with the cooler it would be awsome and 5star product it is bit difficult to find a stand for this particular model as it is a jumbo one
the item is just perfect and my mom has this since last 3 years ans now i have this too perfect product
light indicater and l1 l2 not showing product
cooler is good but only auto swing is not working
great qualitycooling is nice
nice product
super cooling capacity excellent desert cooler
not that good that mentioned
writing after using this air cooler for more than a week pros1 best pricing compared to other coolers with overall same specifications2 the body looks durable and attractive3 less energy consumptioncons 1 the motor doesnt feel that powerful2 makes more noise compared to my old symphony jumbo 70 lconclusion according to me if someone is looking for a branded plastic body cooler with an overall nice performance and also in range of 7k they must go for it
its awesome cooler huge cooler like bahubali super tough body and serve it purpose of cooling big space in no time very happy thanks maharaja and flipkart
finalize in 65k so very nice budget cooler
ok fine work
worst cooler ever poor cooling fan speed is too slow even my normal ceiling fan provides better air worst product from maharaja and flipkart sad part is they do not refund the money as well only replacement option is availablevery disappointed from flipkart
worst
i am happy
thanks i happy
superb
super
nice worth for money
cooling is ok fan speed is good must buy if u want best cooler in summer fantastic delivery too
cooler is good for a big roomonly thing that i didnt liked is the the inlet given for putting water manually inside the tankthis cooler is only feasible if you can buy a inlet pipe which should be used to fill the tank by connecting it with tapso for all the buyers please keep that thing in mind before buying it because that point is not mentioned anywhere in the descriptionfan speed cooling capacity and rest of the features are excellent
i got 7199 best in segment
good product in this price
pros big in size give cool air good air flow not too noise and better than symphony jumbocon no stand and problem in water filling because the cap is small
durability is questionablecooling is normal
very good cooling it will really cool the room very efficientonly demerit is the lack of wheels u need to get a trolley if u want to use it movable
superb
very nice product
product is very powerful cooling capacity very good
not up to the mark in didplay front side l1 l2 blinkings are displayingbut the same is missing in productfan speed is not up to expectations and cooling also very lessfeeling humidity in room over all experience is average product i can give 3 out of 5by seeing previous reviews and experiences i had bought it but i dont recommend to others

awesome air cooler but they should provide stand or wheel with the product

well bulid quality and excellent cooling air but the water pump is not that good
great cooling at night but creates humidity in noon time but i am still glad as i need blanket in summer also
size is too big useful for functions only making too much sound
