sound quality is good considering the price at this range though it could be better battery backup is decent it can serve upto two days in heavy usage the only problem is that after using for after one or two months it start producing a beep sound in some point of especially in the interval of two song and some time it couldnt catch the low frequency sounds as im writing this review after almost 3 monnths and continuous facing this problem anyway price plays a definite role here

there is no doubt about the products pros i have found no cons as yet except its bluetooth rangebattery backup is way more ahead than so called boat mi realme etc this is a hidden gem in no cost go for it and for new buyers i have used level u boat boult earlier and by far this is best value for money product and in addition prompt delivery from flipkart is best just need a check on bluetooth range but that is ok keeping price in mind

nice headphone value for money product bass is very good vocal clear build kawlity is very good highly recommend
totallyworth the amount i am fully satisfied with the product its worth evry penny but i would have been more satisfied if there was a cover for the charging port as wellas dust can easily go inside the port otherwise great product by oneplus ordered and got it delivered before 24 hours i would submit another review after 1 month todays 4722
sound quality is excellent bass is awesome balanced bass and treblebuild quality is good but one plus z bass edition has better build quality in comparison of thisbattery backup is awesome as per commitment it is actual approximately 28 hourswire texture looks premium quality very comfortableoverall value for money neckband wireless earphone in this price segment dont go with bad reviews its really awesome

writing this review after using this product for two weeks so u can find ur neck band prose a loude and clear music amazing bass quality 124mm driv just blows up mind clear instrument sounds good batry back up nice build quality and hand free usage design of buds is good fits in ear clear voice calls cons heavy bass sometimes suppress vocals absence of quick switch option blutooth v5oover all like me other bass or loud music lovers dont think jus
superb product actually i wont prefer wireless headphones but i loved this one base i nice not too much high and vocals are superb just go for it
this is worth every penny you spend i doesnt disappoint in any way delivery was 2 days and charged it before using and i have been using it for 10 hours straight and its still 90 charge i dont know currently how much time it would last though i wont count till then because i trust the brand and so far battery looks awesomethe sound quality is different from the boat rockerz i was using as it consists more mettalic type of bass and it feels amazing its easy to use by just seperatin
as a matter of giving review about this product i m using dis from three week so giving 3 out of 5 because one plus didnt improve the sound quality at all they r giving same sound quality as the previous version except the bass bass is little bit high and most of all the battery life is good from the last version base edition but not as good as they are claiming 30 hours it is hardly giving 1516hours battery backup thats why i am giving the 3 stars for same sound quality a
am never feel the experience of wireless earphones before it so its my first bought to go for oneplus brand even its from china well i love the sound quality still have to check the battery backup but its works awesome very light weight price is need to little low but its fine to go for it and i loved it
actually nothing changed too much in sound there is change only in size of ear buds and button i have both oneplus z bass edition and this new one but i found almost same even fitting of earbud is good of previous one if you have z bass edition then i will not recommend you to upgrade but if you want more battery backup then you can go for it
wireless bullets are first impressions are impressive this price never come this price with this quality and sound was awesome1 sound was amazing i am sony wire headset since 5 years i will see lot of head set i dont like 2 build quality was good3 actually iam bass lover iam waiting for best bass in wireless bullets with best quality this is right one for bass lovers4 price is worth bull5 you can choose this one
dont buy this product during the call other ends voice is very low and on the top of flipkart will never support in rufunds this is geniune feedback after using the working product after few days for music listening this headphone has great voice output
i will say in one word it is fantastic awesome fabulous marvellous it is one of the good best bluethoot neckband because of the sound the bass the mic the battery the call quality the way of design is very very very good for the year of 2022 the oneplus bluethoot is more far better than other bluethoot neckband so it called by the people one is all i e oneplus bluethoot wireless z2 overall it is very good product so i am really happy fully satisfied with this product so guys it
in summary good built comfortable and decent battry backup with bass heavy soundso you will not get a balanced sound bass is present in every bit of voice and volume level and i dont like the muffled bass voices while listning songs or watching movies unless its an pop song but if you are looking for decent built and very good comfort for all day use then you can buy them definitely
battery backup excellent charging speed excellent sound quality excellent build quality very goodaudio of video latency fair fair good very good excellent
1 in terms of build quality poor oneplus bullets wireless z was 10 times better then this price was same of this but that was more comfortable around your neck the quality of rubbing so good but in this one you will find no difference between oneplus and any other brands neck band2 connectivity i bought it recently 2 days back and im already facing connectivity issue after detaching these ear burds it should be auto connect to your phone but sometimes its not working also it
sound quality is good but on full volume trouble feels on high side mid volume bass and trouble sounds up to the mark you cant differentiate sound with wired earphone or oneplus bullets z2 on 7080 volume if you love bass music like then go for it battery backup is excellent charge for 10 minutes and it last for 16 to 18 hours easily in bulid quality it feels premium and light weight for sure cons 1 if you have old device or without dolby atmos then the sound quality feels lik

sound quality is good but calling is not good as well bass good dont go for calling
this product are really awesome and sound quality is high levelyou can go for it really i love this product i am very happy
so heres my reviewpros1 the design and build quality is sturdy and nice2 sound quality is good you wont have any bad sound quality even in maximum volume3 battery backup is good tooin my usage the battery lasts for 20hrs atleast i listen to music stay on call sometimes at lower volume until 70 volume4 the fast charging is a game changer here im a quite busy person and i have no time to wait for my phone to even get charge sometimes and here this neckband dominates
if you have a budget of 2k then just go for it ive upgraded from its earlier varient to this nowawesome battery packup lasts easily for 2 days after full chargei mostly charge for just 1015mins with oneplus warp charger and use it for the whole day the charging speed depends on your charger output the charging port type is c if you dont have type c cable then dont worry youll get a small type c cable inside the box that you can use with any charging adaptorsound quality is g
good sound quality good interact voice call best value of money best selling price i will keep supporting for this product i will my friend tell the product details i keep order all friends in future as
price wise worth it good product battery backup is impressive build quality is poor and oneplus connectivity with phone very slowpersonally i am use z for 1year after 1year its show battery issue one day its turn off and didnt on then i decided to brought z2lets see is oneplus bullet wireless z2 lasting 1 year or not thank you big fan of oneplus flipkart
wire quality is really improved over previous version ergonomic design is really impressive but few user may feel difficulty in proper fitting of buds into ears even with smallest one control button is not so good as many a times you need to press it hard and feel unreliable control specially central pause or pickup buttons rest is very good in this price range
this is something i bought for my father as gift the sound could have better like the previous generation of the bullets wireless z but it is still better than most and the battery backup makes up for it
good quality neckband1 super sound2 super design3 best battery backup 2 day easily4neckband rubber is not good quality bad quality rubber use5 all over good
it is wonderful one of the most best quality neckband sound also good and battery pickup is also superb thanku flipkart
the connectivity with mobile is very good but not compatible with laptop there is not specified in specifications that not compatible with laptop dear be carefull before purchase
good product with great sound quality and battery backup im satisfied thank you flipkart
nice but u can more improvement in this product like a divine sound quality
they are very nice headphones with good sound quality and in good price blindly can go for it
nice quality product awesome noise filtering by the mic side great call quality best feature is that it goes to standby when the buds are magnetically stuck to each other when not in the ear and automatically turns on and reconnects when separated saves power and minimises radiation exposure music experience became good when i adjusted the equaliser in my phone totally love this product
i own z1 bass edition and i can say that the build quality is decreased the thickness of the band is decreased and the magnet is also less effective if compared with z1 bass edition only battery is improved and little bit sound increase still i love one plus
my honest review after using past 1 week oneplus wireless z2 bass edition does not have loud sound ear pain due to little big design as compared to wireless z bass editionloud sound no 2 stardesign 2 starbattery 5 starbuild quality 4 starnote i prefer to use oneplus wireless z bass edition for good quality sound and good bass wireless bass edition z2 is not satisfied and dont buy these earphonesthere is no refund policy for this product
very very good and wonderful neckband i have never used a neckband like this worth for going for it a honest review after use of 1 month

sound is good battery backup is also good and product quality is also good not getting any charging lock to save from water and product size is bigger in comparison with one plus z so its getting uncomfortable to using long office meeting
sound quality superb but build quality poor as compared to one plus bullet z and bass edition
